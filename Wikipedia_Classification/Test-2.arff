'  POV date March 2012   \n  \'  \'  \' Aesthetic relativism \'  \'  \'  is the philosophical view that the judgement of   beauty   is   relativism relative   to different individuals and or cultures and that there are no universal criteria of beauty  For example  in historical terms  the female form as depicted in the   Venus of Willendorf   and the women in the paintings of   Rubens   would today be regarded as over weight  while the slim models on the covers of contemporary fashion magazines would no doubt be regarded in a negative light by our predecessors  In contemporary  cross cultural  terms    body modification   among  quot   primitive culture primitive   quot  peoples is sometimes regarded as   grotesque   by Western society  \n  \n Aesthetic relativism might be regarded as a sub set of an overall philosophical   relativism    which denies any absolute standards of   truth   or   morality   as well as of aesthetic judgement   A frequently cited source for philosophical relativism in   postmodern   theory is a fragment by   Nietzsche    entitled  quot On Truth and Lie in an Extra Moral Sense  quot   \n  \n Aesthetic relativism is a variety of the philosophy known generally as relativism  which casts doubt on the possibility of direct epistemic access to the  quot external world quot   and which therefore rejects the positive claim that statements made about the external world can be known to be objectively true  Other varieties of relativism include cognitive relativism  the general claim that all truth and knowledge is relative  and Ethical Relativism  the claim that moral judgments are relative   Aesthetic and Ethical relativism are sub categories of Cognitive Relativism  Philosophers who have been influential in relativist thinking include David Hume  particularly his  quot radical scepticism quot  as set out in A Treatise of Human Nature  Thomas Kuhn  with regard to the history and philosophy of science  and particularly his work The Structure of Scientific Revolutions  Friedrich Nietzsche  in moral philosophy and epistemology  and Richard Rorty  on the contingency of language  \n  \n Philosophers who have given influential objectivist accounts include Plato  and in particular his Theory of the Forms  Immanuel Kant  who argued that the judgment of beauty  despite being subjective  is a universally practiced function of the mind  Noam Chomsky  whose  quot nativist quot  theory of linguistics argues for a universal grammar  i e   that language is not as contingent as relativists have argued that it is   \n  \n The most prominent philosophical opponent of aesthetic relativism was Immanuel   Immanuel Kant Kant    who argued that the judgment of beauty  while subjective  is universal   \n  \n Recent experiments in   psychology   seem to contradict aesthetic relativism  In studies of   facial attractiveness   there seems to be wide cross cultural agreement as to what constitutes beauty in the human face  Whether this is down to symmetry or averageness is a matter of disagreement  Studies with infants  presumably too young to have been socialised  have shown that they consistently prefer the kinds of faces which adults judge to be  quot attractive quot   Van Duuren  Kendell Scott   amp  Stark  2003  Langlois  Ritter  Roggman   amp  Vaughn  1991  Samuels  Butterworth  Roberts  Grauper   amp  Hole  1994  Samuels  amp  Ewy  1985  Slater  Bremner  Johnson  Sherwood  Hayes   amp  Brown  2000  The judgement of beauty may be hard wired in human beings  possibly fulfilling an evolutionary role  \n  \n At the same time  the dominant media generated image in terms of facial structure  body shape and hair colour is that associated with northern Europeans  Furthermore  it should be noted that the fashion for darker skin among white people is of relatively recent origin  coinciding with the fashion among the upper classes for sun holidays in the early twentieth century  \n  \n In some cases  common sense may appear to suggest that aesthetic relativism is false  There is widespread agreement   at least among the  quot informed quot  and  quot educated quot  public   as to the aesthetic value of individual works of   architecture      painting      music    etc  The question whether or not such agreement pre exists social conditioning is an ongoing one  and mirrors the broader   nature versus nurture   debate within the social sciences  and within   science   and   philosophy   in general   For example  an informed and educated public might have been informed and educated in different ways  and their tastes might then have been quite divergent   The extent to which   Taste  sociology  taste   might be explained in fundamentally sociological as distinct from aesthetic terms  is a matter of ongoing debate  \n  \n   In sexual choices   \n Aesthetic relativism is common in the social sciences and in   feminist   thought   quot Beauty quot  is regarded as a social construct rather than as fulfilling a natural function  e g  in terms of sexual attraction and reproduction   For example  the tendency to cultural tolerance of signs of ageing such as gray hair and wrinkled skin in men  to a greater extent than in women  is seen by some as culturally determined  This view  however  ignores the fact that the age span for reproduction is markedly different in the two sexes  and consequently the criteria for aesthetic  sexual  attraction may be correspondingly different   On the other hand  men as well as women are under increasing pressure to conform to what some might argue is a media determined ideal of a youthful appearance   \n  \n On the relationship between aesthetics  sexual attraction and   reproduction   see   Arthur Schopenhauer    quot On the Metaphysics of the Love of the Sexes quot   in his major work   The World as Will and Representation       die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung    For Schopenhauer  the criteria for sexual attraction are  in women from the perspective of men  beauty  youth and   health    and  in men from the perspective of women  status  strength and wealth  This is because these are believed to be the optimal conditions for the reproduction of the species  the well being of the potential offspring is always the key concern  although one or both of the partners may be quite unconscious of this  \n  \n    References    \n  \n   \'  \' A Very Short Introduction to Philosophy \'  \'  \n  \n   Category Aesthetic beauty   \n   Category Relativism   \n   Category Aesthetics

quot    gt  \n  \n David Clowney  writing for Contemporary Aesthetics summarizes the central thesis of this book  \n  \n  quot In The Invention of Art  A Cultural History   Larry Shiner claims that   Art   with a capital A    Fine Art    was invented in the west in the eighteenth century  The claim is not original with him  he credits   Paul Oskar Kristeller     s essay    The Modern System of the Arts    as the inspiration for his work  Others have made this claim as well  among them   Pierre Bourdieu      Paul Mattick    and   Terry Eagleton    What Shiner has added is a detailed proof of the Kristeller claim using the methods of intellectual  social  cultural  and art history  \n  \n In brief  the thesis is this  There was a traditional    system of the arts    in the West before the eighteenth century   Other traditional cultures still have a similar system   In that system  an artist or artisan was a skilled maker or practitioner  a work of art was the useful product of skilled work  and the appreciation of the arts was integrally connected with their role in the rest of life     Art     in other words  meant approximately the same thing as the Greek word techne  or in English      skill       a sense that has survived in phrases like    the art of war        the art of love     and    the art of medicine     quot  lt ref gt   cite journal url http   www

functions  in addition to their decorative value    \n  \n Few modern scholars have been more divided than Plato and Aristotle on the question concerning the importance of art  with Aristotle strongly supporting art in general and Plato generally being opposed to its relative importance  Several dialogues in Plato tackle questions about art  Socrates says that poetry is inspired by the   muses    and is not rational  He speaks approvingly of this  and other forms of divine madness  drunkenness  eroticism  and dreaming  in the  \'  \'   Phaedrus  Plato  Phaedrus    \'  \'  265a   c   and yet in the  \'  \'   Republic  Plato   \'  \' Republic \'  \'    \'  \'  wants to outlaw Homer \' s great poetic art  and laughter as well  In  \'  \'   Ion  dialogue  Ion   \'  \'   Socrates gives no hint of the disapproval of Homer that he expresses in the  \'  \' Republic \'  \'   The dialogue  \'  \' Ion \'  \'  suggests that   Homer   \' s  \'  \'   Iliad   \'  \'  functioned in the ancient Greek world as the Bible does today in the modern Christian world  as divinely inspired literary art that can provide moral guidance  if only it can be properly interpreted  With regards to the literary art and the musical arts  Aristotle considered   epic poetry    tragedy  comedy    Dithyramb dithyrambic poetry   and music to be   Mimesis mimetic   or imitative art  each varying in imitation by medium  object  and manner  lt ref gt Aristotle   \'  \' Poetics \'  \'  I 1447a lt  ref gt  For example  music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony  whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone  and poetry with language  The forms also differ in their object of imitation  Comedy  for instance  is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average  whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average  Lastly  the forms differ in their manner of imitation     through narrative or character  through change or no change  and through drama or no drama  lt ref gt Aristotle   \'  \' Poetics \'  \'  III lt  ref gt  Aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind \' s advantages over animals  lt ref gt Aristotle   \'  \' Poetics \'  \'  IV lt  ref gt  \n  \n The second  and more recent  sense of the word  \'  \' art \'  \'  as an abbreviation for  \'  \' creative art \'  \'  or  \'  \' fine art \'  \'  emerged in the early 17th century  lt ref gt   Shorter Oxford English Dictionary The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary     \'  \'   Oxford University Press   \'  \'   Oxford 1993  p  amp nbsp 120 lt  ref gt  Fine art refers to a skill used to express the artist \' s creativity  or to engage the audience \' s aesthetic sensibilities  or to draw the audience towards consideration of more refined or  \'  \' finer \'  \'  work of art  \n  \n Within this latter sense  the word  \'  \' art \'  \'  may refer to several things   i  a study of a creative skill   ii  a process of using the creative skill   iii  a product of the creative skill  or  iv  the audience \' s experience with the creative skill  The creative arts   \'  \' art \'  \'  as discipline  are a collection of disciplines which produce  \'  \' artworks \'  \'    \'  \' art \'  \'  as objects  that are compelled by a personal drive  art as activity  and convey a message  mood  or symbolism for the perceiver to interpret  art as experience    Art is something that stimulates an individual \' s thoughts  emotions  beliefs  or ideas through the senses  Works of art can be explicitly made for this purpose or interpreted on the basis of images or objects  For some scholars  such as   Kant    the sciences and the arts could be distinguished by taking science as representing the domain of knowledge and the arts as representing the domain of the freedom of artistic expression  \n  \n Often  if the skill is being used in a common or practical way  people will consider it a craft instead of art  Likewise  if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way  it may be considered   commercial art   instead of fine art  On the other hand  crafts and design are sometimes considered   applied art    Some art followers have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference  lt ref gt David Novitz   quot The Boundaries of Art quot   1992 lt  ref gt  However  even fine art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self expression  The purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas  such as in politically  spiritually  or philosophically motivated art  to create a sense of beauty  see   aesthetics     to explore the nature of perception  for pleasure  or to generate strong   emotion  s  The purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent  \n  \n The nature of art has been described by philosopher   Richard Wollheim   as  quot one of the most elusive of the traditional problems of human culture quot   lt ref gt Richard Wollheim   \'  \' Art and its objects \'  \'   p 1  2nd edn  1980  Cambridge University Press  ISBN 0 521 29706 0 lt  ref gt  Art has been defined as a vehicle for the expression or

art of one of the great ancient civilizations    Ancient Egypt      Mesopotamia      History of Iran Persia    India  China  Ancient Greece  Rome  as well as   Inca      Maya civilization Maya    and   Olmec    Each of these centers of early civilization developed a unique and characteristic style in its art  Because of the size and duration of these civilizations  more of their art works have survived and more of their influence has been transmitted to other cultures and later times  Some also have provided the first records of how artists worked  For example  this period of Greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature  poise  beauty  and anatomically correct proportions  \n  \n In   Byzantine art Byzantine   and   Medieval art   of the Western Middle Ages  much art focused on the expression of subjects about Biblical and religious culture  and used styles that showed the higher glory of a heavenly world  such as the use of gold in the background of paintings  or glass in mosaics or windows  which also presented figures in idealized  patterned  flat  forms  Nevertheless a classical realist tradition persisted in small Byzantine works  and realism steadily grew in the art of Catholic Europe  \n  \n   Renaissance art   had a greatly increased emphasis on the realistic depiction of the material world  and the place of humans in it  reflected in the corporeality of the human body  and development of a systematic method of   graphical perspective   to depict recession in a three dimensional picture space  \n   File Tugra Mahmuds II gif right thumb The stylized signature of   Sultan     Mahmud II   of the   Ottoman Empire   was written in   Arabic calligraphy    It reads  \'  \' Mahmud

religion dominated artistic styles and forms too  India and Tibet saw emphasis on painted sculptures and dance  while religious painting borrowed many conventions from sculpture and tended to bright contrasting colors with emphasis on outlines  China saw the flourishing of many art forms  jade carving  bronzework  pottery  including the stunning   terracotta army   of Emperor Qin   poetry  calligraphy  music  painting  drama  fiction  etc  Chinese styles vary greatly from era to era and each one is traditionally named after the ruling dynasty  So  for example    Tang Dynasty   paintings are monochromatic and sparse  emphasizing idealized landscapes  but   Ming Dynasty   paintings are busy and colorful  and focus on telling stories via setting and composition  Japan names its styles after imperial dynasties too  and also saw much interplay between the styles of calligraphy and painting    Woodblock printing   became important in Japan after the 17th century  \n  \n   File Ma Lin

artistic depictions of physical and rational certainties of the clockwork universe  as well as politically revolutionary visions of a post monarchist world  such as   William Blake Blake   \' s portrayal of Newton as a divine geometer  or   Jacques Louis David David   \' s propagandistic paintings  This led to   Romanticism Romantic   rejections of this in favor of pictures of the emotional side and individuality of humans  exemplified in the novels of   Goethe    The late 19th century then saw a host of artistic movements  such as   academic art      Symbolism  arts  Symbolism      impressionism   and   fauvism   among others  \n  \n The history of twentieth century art is a narrative of endless possibilities and the search for new standards  each being torn down in succession by the next  Thus the parameters of   Impressionism      Expressionism      Fauvism      Cubism      Dadaism      Surrealism    etc  cannot be maintained very much beyond the time of their invention  Increasing   globalization global   interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into Western art  Thus  Japanese woodblock prints  themselves influenced by Western Renaissance draftsmanship  had an immense influence on Impressionism and subsequent development  Later    African art African sculptures   were taken up by Picasso and to some extent by   Matisse    Similarly  in the 19th and 20th centuries the West has had huge impacts on Eastern art with originally western ideas like   Communism   and   Post Modernism   exerting a powerful influence  \n  \n   Modernism    the idealistic search for truth  gave way in the latter half of the 20th century to a realization of its unattainability     Theodor W  Adorno   said in 1970   quot It is now taken for granted that nothing which concerns art can be taken for granted any more  neither art itself  nor art in relationship to the whole  nor even the right of art to exist  quot  lt ref gt Adorno  Theodor W    \'  \' Aesthetic Theory \'  \'    1970 in German  lt  ref gt    Relativism   was accepted as an unavoidable truth  which led to the period of   contemporary art   and   List of postmodern critics postmodern criticism    where cultures of the world and of history are seen as changing forms  which can be appreciated and drawn from only with   skepticism   and irony  Furthermore  the separation of cultures is increasingly blurred and some argue it is now more appropriate to think in terms of a global culture  rather than of regional ones  \n  \n   Forms  genres  media  and styles   \n   Main

fields  art is one of the few subjects that are academically organized according to technique  An artistic   recording medium medium   is the substance or material the artistic work is made from  and may also refer to the technique used  For example  paint is a medium used in painting  and paper is a medium used in drawing  \n  \n An  \'  \'  \'  \'  \' art form \'  \'  \'  \'  \'  is the specific  \'  \' shape \'  \'   or quality an artistic expression takes  The media used often influence the form  For example  the   shape form   of a sculpture must exist in space in three dimensions  and respond to gravity  The constraints and limitations of a particular medium are thus called its  \'  \'  \'  \'  \' formal qualities \'  \'  \'  \'  \'   To give another example  the formal qualities of painting are the canvas texture  color  and brush texture  The formal qualities of video games are non linearity  interactivity and virtual presence  \n The  \'  \' form \'  \'  of a particular work of art is determined by the formal qualities of the media  and is not related to the intentions of the artist or the reactions of the audience in any way whatsoever as these properties are

Pollock   is called an   Abstract Expressionist    \n  \n A particular style may have specific cultural meanings  For example    Roy Lichtenstein     a painter associated with the American   Pop art   movement of the 1960s   was not a   Pointillism pointillist    despite his use of dots  Lichtenstein used evenly spaced   Ben Day dots    the type used to reproduce color in comic strips  as a style to question the  quot high quot  art of painting with the  quot low quot  art of comics  thus commenting on class distinctions in culture  Pointillism  a technique in late Impressionism  1880s  developed especially by the artist   Georges Seurat    employs dots to create variation in color and depth in an attempt to approximate the way people really see color  Both artists use dots  but the particular style and technique relate to the artistic movement adopted by each artist  \n  \n These are all ways of beginning to define a work of art  to narrow it down  \n   quote Imagine you are an art critic whose mission is to compare the meanings you find in a wide range of individual artworks  How would you proceed with your task  One way to begin is to examine the materials each artist selected in making an object  image video  or event  The decision to cast a sculpture in bronze  for instance  inevitably effects its meaning  the work becomes something different from how it might be if it had been cast in gold or plastic or chocolate  even if everything else about the artwork remains the same  Next  you might examine how the materials in each artwork have become an arrangement of shapes  colors  textures  and lines  These  in turn  are organized into various patterns and compositional structures  In your interpretation  you would comment on how salient features of the form contribute to the overall meaning of the finished artwork   But in the end  the meaning of most artworks    is not exhausted by a discussion of materials  techniques  and form  Most interpretations also include a discussion of the ideas and feelings the artwork engenders  lt ref gt Robertson  Jean and Craig McDaniel  Themes of Contemporary Art  Visual Art after 1980  page 4  Oxford University

ancient times  much of the finest art has represented a deliberate display of wealth or power  often achieved by using massive scale and expensive materials  Much art has been commissioned by rulers or religious establishments  with more modest versions only available to the most wealthy in society   Nevertheless  there have been many periods where art of very high quality was available  in terms of ownership  across large parts of society  above all in cheap media such as pottery  which persists in the ground  and perishable media such as textiles and wood  In many different cultures  the   ceramics of indigenous peoples of the Americas   are found in such a wide range of graves that they were clearly not restricted to a   social elite    though other forms of art may have been  Reproductive methods such as   Molding  process  moulds   made mass production easier  and were used to bring high quality   Ancient Roman pottery   and Greek   Tanagra figurine  s to a very wide market    Cylinder seal  s were both artistic and practical  and very widely used by what can be loosely called the middle class in the   Ancient Near East    Once   coin  s were widely used these also became an art form that reached the widest range of society   Another important innovation came in the 15th century in Europe  when   printmaking   began with small   woodcut  s  mostly religious  that were often very small and hand colored  and affordable even by   peasant  s who glued them to the walls of their homes  Printed books were initially very expensive  but fell steadily in price until by the 19th century even the poorest could afford some with printed illustrations     Popular prints   of many different sorts have decorated homes and other places for centuries  \n  \n   Public art Public buildings and monuments    secular and religious  by their nature normally address the whole of society  and visitors as viewers  and display to the general public has long been an important factor in their design    Egyptian temple  s are typical in that the most largest and most lavish decoration was placed on the parts that could be seen by the general public  rather than the areas seen only by the priests   Many areas of royal palaces  castles and the houses of the social elite were often generally accessible  and large parts of the art collections of such people could often be seen  either by anybody  or by those able to pay a small price  or those wearing the correct clothes  regardless of who they were  as at the   Palace of Versailles    where the appropriate extra accessories  silver shoe buckles and a sword  could be hired from shops outside  \n  \n Special arrangements were made to allow the public to see many royal or private collections placed in galleries  as with the   Orleans Collection Collection in Paris Orleans Collection   mostly housed in a wing of the   Palais Royal   in Paris  which could be visited for most of the 18th century  In Italy the art tourism of the   Grand Tour   became a major industry from the Renaissance onwards  and governments and cities made efforts to make their key works accessible   The British   Royal Collection   remains distinct  but large donations such as the   Old Royal Library   were made from it to the   British Museum    established in 1753   The   Uffizi   in   Florence   opened entirely as a gallery in 1765  though this function had been gradually taking the building over from the original civil servants \'  offices for a long time before   The building now occupied by the   Prado   in Madrid was built before the French Revolution for the public display of parts of the royal art collection  and similar royal galleries open to the public existed in   Vienna    Munich and other capitals  The opening of the   Mus  e du Louvre   during the   French Revolution    in 1793  as a public museum for much of the former French royal collection certainly marked an important stage in the development of public access to art  transferring ownership to a republican state  but was a continuation of trends already well established  \n  \n Most modern public museums and art education programs for children in schools can be traced back to this impulse to have art available to everyone  Museums in the United States tend to be gifts from the very rich to the masses    The Metropolitan Museum of Art   in New York City  for example  was created by   John Taylor Johnston    a railroad executive whose personal art collection seeded the museum   But despite all this  at least one of the important functions of art in the 21st century remains as a marker of wealth and social status  \n  \n   File BeuysAchberg78 jpg thumb Performance by   Joseph Beuys    1978   \'  \'

modern controversies are dimly recorded  or completely lost to a modern view    Iconoclasm   is the destruction of art that is disliked for a variety of reasons  including religious ones    Aniconism   is a general dislike of either all figurative images  or often just religious ones  and has been a thread in many major religions  It has been a crucial factor in the history of   Islamic art    where   depictions of Muhammad   remain especially controversial   Much art has been disliked purely because it depicted or otherwise stood for unpopular rulers  parties or other groups  Artistic conventions have often been conservative and taken very seriously by   art critic  s  though often much less so by a wider public   The   iconography iconographic   content of art could cause controversy  as with late medieval depictions of the new motif of the   Swoon of the Virgin   in scenes of the   Crucifixion of Jesus       The Last Judgment  Michelangelo  The  \'  \' Last Judgment \'  \'    by   Michelangelo   was controversial for various reasons  including breaches of   decorum   through nudity and the   Apollo   like pose of Christ  \n  \n The content of much formal art through history was dictated by the patron or commissioner rather than just the artist  but with the advent of   Romanticism    and econonomic changes in the production of art  the artists \'  vision became the usual determinant of the content of his art  increasing the incidence of controversies  though often reducing their significance   Strong incentives for perceived originality and publicity also encouraged artists to court controversy    Th  odore G  ricault   \' s  \'  \'   The Raft of the Medusa Raft of the Medusa   \'  \'   c  1820   was in part a political commentary on a recent

The gradual abandonment of naturalism and the depiction of realistic representations of the visual appearance of subjects in the 19th and 20th centuries led to a rolling controversy lasting for over a century   In the twentieth century    Pablo Picasso   \' s  \'  \'   Guernica  painting  Guernica   \'  \'   1937  used arresting   cubism cubist   techniques and stark   Monochrome painting

The resulting uproar led to comments in the United States Senate about public funding of the arts  \n  \n   Theory   \n   main Aesthetics   \n In the nineteenth century  artists were primarily concerned with ideas of  \'  \' truth \'  \'  and  \'  \' beauty \'  \'   The aesthetic theorist   John Ruskin    who championed what he saw as the naturalism of   J  M  W  Turner J  amp nbsp M  amp

assessing the aesthetic value of art  the   Aesthetic realism Realist    whereby aesthetic quality is an absolute value independent of any human view  the   Objectivity  philosophy  Objectivist    whereby it is also an absolute value  but is dependent on general human experience  and the   Relativist     Aesthetic relativism position    whereby it is not an absolute value  but depends on  and

modern art as  quot the use of characteristic methods of a discipline to criticize the discipline itself quot   lt ref name    quot Frascina quot  gt Modern Art and Modernism  A Critical Anthology  ed

several important art theorists emerged  such as   Michael Fried      T  J  Clark  historian  T  amp nbsp J  amp nbsp Clark      Rosalind Krauss      Linda Nochlin   and   Griselda Pollock   among others  Though only originally intended as a way of understanding a specific set of artists  Greenberg \' s definition of modern art is important to many of the ideas of art within the various art movements of the 20th century and early 21st century  \n  \n   Pop art  ists like   Andy Warhol   became both noteworthy and influential through work including and possibly critiquing popular culture  as well as the   art world    Artists of the 1980s  1990s  and 2000s expanded this technique of self criticism beyond  \'  \' high art \'  \'  to all cultural image making  including fashion images  comics  billboards and pornography  \n  \n Duchamp once proposed that art is any activity of any kind  everything  However  the way that only certain activities are classified today as art is a social construction  lt ref name  quot Duchamp Interview Clip quot  gt   YouTube haon2DXWvLk Duchamp Two Statements   lt  ref gt  There is evidence that there may be an element of truth to this    The Invention of Art  A Cultural History   is an art history book which examines the construction of the modern system of the arts i e    Fine Art    Shiner finds evidence that the older system of the arts before our modern system  fine art  held art to be any skilled human activity i e  Ancient Greek society did not possess the term art but   techne    Techne can be understood neither as art or

medicine    horsemanship      geometry      carpentry      prophecy   and farming etc  \n  \n    New Criticism and the  quot Intentional Fallacy quot     \n Following Duchamp during the first half of the twentieth century  a significant shift to general aesthetic theory took place which attempted to apply aesthetic theory between various forms of art  including the literary arts and the visual arts  to each other  This resulted in the rise of the   New Criticism   school and debate concerning  \'  \' the intentional fallacy \'  \'   At issue was the question of whether the aesthetic intentions of the artist in creating the work of art  whatever its specific form  should be associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final product of the work of art  or  if the work of art should be evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the artist  \n  \n In 1946    W  K  Wimsatt William K  Wimsatt   and   Monroe Beardsley   published a classic and controversial New Critical essay entitled  quot   Intentional Fallacy The Intentional Fallacy   quot   in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an   Authorial intentionality author \' s intention    or  quot intended meaning quot  in the analysis of a literary work   For Wimsatt and Beardsley  the words on the page were all that mattered  importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant  and potentially distracting  \n  \n In another essay   quot   Affective fallacy The Affective Fallacy    quot  which served as a kind of sister essay to  quot The Intentional Fallacy quot  Wimsatt and Beardsley also discounted the reader \' s personal emotional reaction to a literary work as a valid means of analyzing a text  This fallacy would later be repudiated by theorists from the   reader response   school of literary theory  Ironically  one of the leading theorists from this school    Stanley Fish    was himself trained by New Critics  Fish criticizes

were sharply critical of many aspects of New Criticism  beginning with the emphasis on aesthetic appreciation and the so called autonomy of art  but they reiterated the attack on biographical criticisms \' s assumption that the artist \' s activities and experience were a privileged critical topic  quot  lt ref gt Gaut and Livingston   quot The Creation of Art quot   p 3  lt  ref gt  These authors contend that   quot Anti intentionalists  such as formalists  hold that the intentions involved in the making of art are irrelevant or peripheral to correctly interpreting art  So details of

Livingston  p 6  lt  ref gt  \n  \n Gaut and Livingston define the intentionalists as distinct from formalists stating that   quot Intentionalists  unlike formalists  hold that reference to intentions is essential in fixing the correct interpretation of works  quot  They quote   Richard Wollheim   as stating that   quot The task of criticism is the reconstruction of the creative process  where the creative process must in turn be thought of as something not stopping short of  but terminating on  the work of art itself  quot  lt ref name  quot Gaut and Livingston  p 6 quot   gt  \n  \n

National Gallery    Canberra    Australia   \n  \n Somewhat in relation to the above  the word  \'  \' art \'  \'  is also used to apply judgments of value  as in such expressions as  quot that meal was a work of art quot   the cook is an artist   or  quot the art of deception quot    the highly attained level of skill of the deceiver is praised   It is this use of the word as a measure of high quality and high value that gives the term its flavor of subjectivity  \n  \n Making judgments of value requires a basis for criticism  At the simplest level  a way to determine whether the impact of the object on the senses meets the criteria to be considered  \'  \' art \'  \'  is whether it is perceived to be attractive or repulsive  Though perception is always colored by experience  and is necessarily subjective  it is commonly understood that what is not somehow aesthetically satisfying cannot be art  However   quot good quot  art is not always or even regularly aesthetically appealing to a majority of viewers  In other words  an artist \' s prime motivation need not be the pursuit of the aesthetic  Also  art often depicts terrible images made for social  moral  or thought provoking reasons  For example    Francisco Goya   \' s painting depicting the Spanish shootings of 3rd amp nbsp of May 1808 is a graphic depiction of a firing squad executing several pleading civilians  Yet at the same time  the horrific imagery demonstrates Goya \' s keen artistic ability in composition and execution and produces fitting social and political outrage  Thus  the debate continues as to what mode of aesthetic satisfaction  if any  is required to define  \' art \'   \n  \n The assumption of new values or the rebellion against accepted notions of what is aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with a complete abandonment of the pursuit of what is aesthetically appealing  Indeed  the reverse is often true  that the revision of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for a re invigoration of aesthetic sensibility  and a new appreciation for the standards of art itself  Countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality  yet they all seem to agree in at least one point  once their aesthetic choices are accepted  the value of the work of art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen medium to strike some universal chord by the rarity of the skill of the artist or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the  \'  \'   zeitgeist   \'  \'   \n  \n Art is often intended to appeal to and connect with human emotion  It can arouse   aesthetic   or   morality moral   feelings  and can be understood as a way of communicating these feelings  Artists express something so that their audience is aroused to some extent  but they do not have to do so consciously  Art may be considered an exploration of the   human condition    that is  what it is to be human  lt ref gt   cite book   last1

\n  \n Spello   s Infiorate is a manifestation which takes place every year in the small Umbrian town of   Spello    Italy  on the occasion of the   Corpus Domini   feast  on the ninth Sunday after Easter  On that night  almost a thousand people work incessantly to create carpets and pictures made of flowers along the narrow town   s streets  The floral creations cover streets throughout the historical centre in preparation to the passage of the Blessed Sacrament carried in procession by the bishop on Sunday morning  The result is a unique one mile long path of beautiful floral creations with an explosion of colours and scents  \n  \n    History    \n   File Processione Benvenuto Crispoldi jpg thumb Benvenuto Crispoldi  Procession  c  1915   oil painting    The custom of honouring divinity by throwing flowers or creating flower compositions is a dateless event in many areas of the world  In   Spello   this tradition  which has gone from first throwing flowers  then to placing them in art forms on the pavement  is documented in the Municipal archives for the first time in 1831  On the occasion of the visit of bishop Ignazio Cadolini on October 19  1831  the gonfaloniere Francesco Nicoletti asked all citizens with houses facing the main street to    keep clean and free from all rubbish their respective areas around each house and spread flowers and greenery          in occasion of the procession  The iconographic testimonials about the Infiorate in Spello date back to the beginning of the 19th century  Benvenuto Crispoldi  1886   1923   painter and mayor of   Spello    depicted the procession of   Corpus Domini   on the flower carpets in one of his paintings  \n In the city archives we can find many pictures belonging to the Fascist period  in which references to the political environment are very evident  We can see Infiorate containing Casa del Fascio in the background  a landmark of fascist architecture  and even Swastika decoration motifs  Such influences are clear examples of how religious devotion  which has always been the foundation of Infiorate  was influenced and interpreted depending upon the historical and social context  \n   File Infiorata d \' epoca Spello jpg thumb Spello \' s Infiorate  vintage photo     \n   File Infiorate Spello anni 70 jpg thumb Spello \' s infiorate in the  \' 70s   \n As techniques evolved over time  what was once a long uninterrupted carpet of flowers  characterized by a relatively simple design  morphed into separate  more sophisticated sets of bigger compositions  Distinct groups of creators emerged  focusing on improving artistic execution and addressing more complex religious and social messages  Starting from the mid 60s  Infiorate   s design  until then characterized by geometrical schemes and central figures with symbols almost exclusively connected to the Corpus Domini  evolved constantly  reaching by the end of the 80s a style dominated by the presence of a central composition  \n   File Infiorata Spello 1987 jpg thumb Spello \' s Infiorata  The escape from Egypt  1987     \n   File Infiorata Spello 2012 2a classif jpg thumb Spello \' s Infiorata  2012     \n The flower carpets  in its own a form of true painting with flower petals  have reached over time high levels of technical sophistication which  coupled with the expression and interpretation of increasingly complex and often abstract socio religious themes  forced the Infiorate   s artists to dedicate more time to the concept and design stage as well as to the in depth study of philosophical and historical themes  \n In the 60s the creation of a contest to recognize the best infiorata has stimulated the competition among the groups of artists and has led to an accelerated development and improvement in the quality of the compositions  The first informal competitions were organized by the prelates of the two main Spello   s parishes  S  Maria Maggiore and S  Lorenzo Martire  Since 1962  when the first official  contest was established thanks to the funding and sponsorship of Pro Loco  local agency for the promotion of tourism presided at the time by Prof  Giacomo Prampolini   the anticipation for the proclamation of the best infiorata has become an important and essential corollary to the festivity of Corpus Domini in Spello  \n The prize consists in the right to hold for a year onto a bronze statue of Sesto Properzio  c  47     14 amp nbsp B C    the Latin poet whose birthplace is contended between Spello and   Assisi    \n In recent years  the fame of Spello   s Infiorate has reached out of the regional and national borders  Their creators are called to compose flower carpets for special occasions or to honour institutional political and religious figures such as Popes  John Paul II  and Italian Republic Presidents  Sandro Pertini and Oscar Luigi Scalfaro   They have also had the honour of taking their art to iconoclastic religious places  such as Lourdes and Bethlehem  \n   File Infiorata Roma Giubileo jpg thumb Infiorata at Piazza del Popolo  Rome for the Jubilee  2000     \n Since 2002 infiorate   s artists have been organized independently as the association    Le Infiorate di Spello     http   www infioratespello it  with the purpose of promoting the manifestation  maintaining and enhancing the quality of the compositions and preserving the continuity of this important tradition  Over the course of the last 10 amp nbsp years the association has seen its base expanding to almost 1000 members  in representation of more than 40 groups of artists  \n  \n    Techniques    \n Differently from other similar manifestations  Spello   s Infiorate creators compose their splendid carpets using flowers collected in the wild  While the use of other parts of the plants  like leaves and berries is allowed  the preference is given to the use of petals only  either fresh or dried  The use of wood and any kind of synthetic material is severely prohibited  \n Exsiccation of the flowers must be carried out naturally in the sun  Dried petals are sometime gently chopped to improve their deployment in high resolution details and fine design elements  However  they cannot be turned into a powder as the floral nature and appearance of the material have to be always preserved  The gathering  meticulous collection and processing of these natural materials starts several months before their actual use  becoming often a year around effort in order to tap into the variety of seasonal floral species  \n    File Infiorate Spello lavorazione JPG thumb Spello \' s infioratori at work    \n Drawings are either traced on the streets using chalk and the technique of division into squares  or drawn onto paper and then stuck to the ground  thus allowing bigger and more complex designs  The representations  always inspired by religious themes  often contain intricate three dimensional effects  usually obtained with the use of  prospective  shading and layering of the flowers  without the use of any glue  Each infiorata must have either a minimum length of 12 amp nbsp metres  or cover a surface of at least 24 amp nbsp square

can also refer to the   Atelier Method    a training method for artists that usually takes place in a professional artist \' s studio  \n  \n The above mentioned  quot method quot  calls upon that zeal for study to play a significant role in the production which occurs in a studio space  A studio is more or less artful to the degree that the artist who occupies it is committed to the continuing education in his or her formal discipline  Academic curricula categorize studio classes in order to prepare students for the rigors of building sets of skills which require a continuity of practice in order to achieve growth and mastery of their artistic expression  A versatile and creative mind will embrace the opportunity of such practice to innovate and experiment  which develops uniquely individual qualities of each artist \' s expression  Thus the method raises and maintains an art studio space above the level of a mere production facility or workshop  \n  \n Safety is or may be a

Sciences of the Artificial \'  \'  by polymath   Herbert A  Simon   the author asserts design to be a meta discipline of all professions   quot Engineers are not the only professional designers  Everyone designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones  The intellectual activity that produces material artifacts is no different fundamentally from the one that prescribes remedies for a sick patient or the one that devises a new sales plan for a company or a social welfare policy for a state  Design  so construed  is the core of all professional training  it is the principal mark that distinguishes the professions from the sciences  Schools of engineering  as well as schools of architecture  business  education  law  and medicine  are all

general philosophy that may or may not include a guide for specific methods  Some are to guide the overall goal of the design  Other approaches are to guide the tendencies of the designer  A combination of approaches may be used if they don \' t conflict  \n  \n Some popular approaches include  \n     KISS principle     Keep it Simple Stupid   which strives to eliminate unnecessary complications  \n     There is more than one way to do it    TIMTOWTDI   a philosophy to allow multiple methods of doing the same thing  \n     Use centered design    which focuses on the goals and tasks associated with the use of the artifact  rather than focusing on the end user  \n     User centered design    which focuses on the needs  wants  and limitations of the end user of the designed artifact  \n     Critical design   uses designed artifacts as an embodied critique or commentary on existing values  morals  and practices in a culture  \n     Service design   designing or organizing the experience around a product  the service associated with a product \' s use  \n     Transgenerational design    the practice of making products and environments compatible with those physical and sensory impairments associated with human aging and which limit major activities of daily living  \n  Speculative design  the speculative design process doesn   t necessarily define a specific problem to solve  but establishes a provocative starting point from which a design process emerges  The result is an evolution of fluctuating iteration and reflection using designed objects to provoke

Ulm  in Germany during the 20th Century  \n  \n The boundaries between art and design are blurred  largely due to a range of applications both for the term  \' art \'  and the term  \' design \'

distinction is often made between   fine art   and   commercial art    based on the context within which the work is produced and how it is traded  \n  \n To a degree  some methods for creating work  such as employing intuition  are shared across the disciplines within the   Applied arts   and   Fine art    Mark Getlein suggests the principles of design are  quot almost instinctive quot    quot

and production    \n The relationship between design and   Production  costs  and pricing production   is one of planning and executing  In theory  the plan should anticipate and compensate for potential problems in the execution process  Design involves problem solving and   creativity    In contrast  production involves a routine or pre planned process  A design may also be a mere plan that does not include a production or engineering processes although a working knowledge of such processes is usually expected of designers  In some cases  it may be unnecessary and or impractical to expect a designer with a broad   multidisciplinary   knowledge required for such designs to also have a detailed   Division of labour specialized   knowledge of how to produce the product  \n  \n Design and production are intertwined in many   creative professional   careers  meaning problem solving is part of execution and the reverse  As the cost of rearrangement increases  the need for separating design from production increases as well  For example  a high budget project  such as a   skyscraper    requires separating  design    architect  ure from  production    construction    A Low budget project  such as a   Multifunction printer locally printed   office party invitation   Flyer  pamphlet  flyer    can be rearranged and printed dozens of times at the low cost of a few sheets of paper  a few drops of ink  and less than one hour \' s pay of a   desktop publishing desktop publisher    \n  \n This is not to say that production never involves problem solving or creativity  nor that design always involves creativity  Designs are rarely perfect and are sometimes repetitive  The imperfection of a design may task a production position  e g    production artist      construction worker    with utilizing creativity or problem solving skills to compensate for what was overlooked in the design process  Likewise  a design may be a simple repetition  copy  of a known preexisting solution  requiring minimal  if any  creativity or problem solving skills from the designer  \n  \n   File BPMN DiscussionCycle jpg thumb An example of a business workflow process

an art   The common usage in both everyday   speech   and academic   discourse   is a practitioner in the   visual art  s only   The term is often used in the   entertainment   business  especially in a business context  for musicians and other performers  less often for   actor  s     quot Artiste quot   the French for artist  is a variant used in English only in this context   Use of the term to describe writers  for example  is certainly valid  but less common  and mostly restricted to contexts like   criticism     \n  \n   Dictionary definitions   \n Wiktionary defines the noun  \' artist

sculpture  In ancient Greece sculptors and painters were held in low regard  somewhere between freemen and slaves  their work regarded as mere manual labour  lt ref gt  \n  \'  \' In Our Time  The Artist \'  \'    BBC Radio 4    TX 28th March 2002 lt  ref gt  \n  \n The word  \'  \' art \'  \'  derives from the Latin  quot ars quot   stem  \'  \' art  \'  \'    which  although literally defined  means  quot   skill   method quot  or  quot technique quot   and conveys a connotation of   beauty    \n  \n During the Middle Ages the word  \'  \' artist \'  \'  already existed in some countries such as   Italy    but the meaning was something resembling  \'  \' craftsman \'  \'   while the word  \'  \' artesan \'  \'  was still unknown  An artist was someone able to do a work better than others  so the skilled excellency was underlined  rather than the activity field  In this period some  quot artisanal quot  products  such as textiles  were much more precious and expensive than paintings or sculptures  \n  \n The first division into major and minor arts dates back at least to the works of   Leon Battista Alberti    1404 1472    \'  \'   De re aedificatoria    De statua  De pictura \'  \'   which focused on the importance of the intellectual skills of the artist rather than the manual skills  even if in other forms of art there was a   project   behind   lt ref gt  \n P Galloni   \'  \' Il sacro artefice  Mitologie degli artigiani medievali \'  \'   Laterza    Bari    1998 lt  ref gt  \n  \n With the   Academy Academies   in Europe  second half of 16th century  the gap between fine and applied arts was definitely set  \n  \n Many contemporary definitions of  quot artist quot  and  quot art quot  are highly contingent on   culture    resisting aesthetic prescription  in much the same way that the features constituting beauty and the beautiful cannot be standardized easily without corruption into   kitsch    \n  \n   The present day concept of an  \' artist \'    \n  \'  \' Artist \'  \'  is a descriptive term applied to a person who engages in an activity deemed to be an art  An artist also may be defined unofficially as  quot a person who expresses him  or herself through a medium quot   The word is also used in a qualitative sense of  a person   creativity creative   in    innovation innovative   in  or adept at  an artistic practice  \n  \n Most often  the term describes those who create within a context of the fine arts or  \'   high culture   \'   activities such as   drawing      painting      sculpture      acting      dancing      writing      filmmaking      New media art new media      photography    and   music     people who use imagination  talent  or skill to create works that may be judged to have an   aesthetic   value    Art history Art historians   and   Art critic critics   define artists as those who produce art within a recognized or recognizable discipline   Contrasting terms for highly skilled workers in media in the   applied arts   or   decorative arts   include   artisan      Master craftsman craftsman    and specialized terms such as   pottery potter      goldsmith   or   glassblower     Fine arts artists such as painters succeeded in the   Renaissance   in raising their status  formerly similar to these workers  to a decisively higher level  but in the 20th century the distinction became rather less relevant   Citation needed date April 2010    \n  \n The term may also be used loosely or metaphorically to denote highly skilled people in any non  quot art quot  activities  as well    law  medicine  mechanics  or mathematics  for example  \n  \n Often  discussions on the subject focus on the differences among  quot artist quot  and  quot   technician   quot    quot   entertainer   quot  and  quot   artisan   quot    quot   fine arts fine art   quot  and  quot   applied art   quot   or what constitutes art and what does not  The   French language French   word  \'  \' artiste \'

social practice    literacy   is seen as a key dimension of community regeneration and a part of the wider lifelong learning agenda   In particular  literacy is considered to be an area of instruction for the introduction of social practice through social language and social identity  According to social practice in education  literacy and   numeracy   are complex  capabilities rather than a simple set of basic skills  Furthermore  adult learners are more likely to develop and retain knowledge  skills  and understanding if they see them as relevant to their own problems and challenges  Social practice perspectives focus on local literacies and how literacy practices are affected by settings and groups interacting around print  \n  \n    Literature    \n As literature is repeatedly studied in education and critiqued in discourse  many believe that it should be a field of social practice as it evokes emotion and discussion of social interactions and social conditions  Those that believe literature may be construed as a form of social practice believe that literature and society are essentially related to each other  As such  they attempt to define specific sociological practices of literature and share expressions of literature as works comprising text  institution  and individual  Overall  literature becomes a realm of social exchange through fiction  poetry  politics  and

dropped in the circle created by the previous drop  The colors separate from the water and rise on the water \' s surface  The resulting pattern is ready for dipping the nail  but it can still be modified by creating different shapes with a stick  Later  the nail is dipped into the pattern on the water and kept under water as   Q tip   is used to  quot grab quot  the remaining polish  \n  \n

' \n   Tales and myths of impalement   \n  \n    Europe    \n  \n     Vampires and other undead     \n The idea that the vampire  quot can  \'  \' only \'  \'  be slain with a stake driven through its heart quot  has been pervasive in European fiction  Examples such as Bram Stoker \' s   Dracula   and the more recent   Buffy the Vampire Slayer  TV series  Buffy The Vampire Slayer   and   Twilight  series  Twilight   series \'  all incorporate that idea  lt ref gt For popularity claim and example  http   www dailymail co uk news article 2155602 Vampire skeletons impaled iron stakes say arent just film fantasy html Thought vampires were just film fantasy  Skeletons impaled on iron stakes say otherwise  lt  ref gt  In classic European folklore  it was believed that one method   \'  \' among several \'  \'   to  quot kill quot  a   vampire    or prevent a corpse from rising as a vampire  was to drive a wooden stake through the heart before interment  lt ref gt  \'  \' Barber \'  \'   2010  lt  ref gt  In one story  an   Istria  n peasant named   Jure Grando   died and was buried in 1656  It was believed that he returned as a vampire  and at least one villager tried to drive a stake through his heart  but failed in the attempt  Finally  in 1672  the corpse was   decapitation decapitated    and the vampire terror was put to rest  lt ref gt  \'  \' Caron \'  \'   2001  lt  ref gt  Although the Eastern European  in particular Slavic  but also Roumanian   conception of the vampire as an undead creature in which impaling it was central to either destroying it  or at least immobilizing it  is the most well known European tradition  such traditions can also be found elsewhere in Europe  In Greece  the troublesome undead were usually called a   vrykolakas    The archaeologist Susan Marie Cronkite lt ref gt  http   www elementshealthspace com masthead  Bio on Cronkite  lt  ref gt  describes an odd grave found at   Mytilene    at   Lesbos    a find the archeologists connected with the vrykolakas superstition  lt ref gt  \'  \' Cronkite \'  \'  2008  lt  ref gt  \n  \n The Norse   draugr    or haugbui  mound dweller   was a type of undead typically  but not exclusively  associated with those put  supposedly  to rest in burial mounds   tumulus tumuli    The approved methods of killing a draugr are  quot to sever his head from his body and set the same beneath his rump  or impale his body with a stake or burn it to ashes quot   lt ref gt  \'  \' Andrews \'  \'   1913   p 603  Several examples in the essay on grave robbery and encounters with draugr there and elsewhere lt  ref gt  \n  \n Although in modern vampiric lore  the stake is regarded as a very effective tool against the undead  people in pre modern Europe could have their doubts    Edward Payson Evans   tells the following story  from the city   Kada      lt ref gt  \'  \' Evans \'  \'   1906    http   books google no books id delFlcGFniYC amp pg PA196 p 196  lt  ref gt   quote In 1337  a herdsman near the town of Cadan came forth from his grave every night  visiting the villages  terrifying the inhabitants  conversing affably with some and murdering others  Every person  with whom he associated  was doomed to die within eight days and to wander as a vampire after death  In order to keep him in his grave  a stake was driven through his body  but he only laughed at this clumsy attempt to impale a ghost  saying   quot You have really rendered me a great service by providing me with a staff  with which to ward off dogs when I go out to walk quot    \n  \n     Literary treatment of impalement     \n A graphic description of the vertical impalement of a Serbian rebel by Ottoman authorities can be found in   Ivo Andri     \' s novel  \'  \'   The Bridge on the Drina

    \n Some anecdotes of the behavior and fates of the impaled remain which  if true  would be unique in the history of impalement  The first was narrated as a proof of the efficacy of praying to   Saint Barbara    In the woods of Bohemia around 1552  there was a robber band roaming  plundering and murdering innocent travelers  A manhunt was organized  and the robber chief was apprehended and sentenced to be impaled  While one of his associates  likewise impaled  swiftly expired  the chief was not so lucky  \n All day long  he writhed on his stake  begging to be killed  but all in vain  That night  in his despair  he prayed to St  Barbara that he was truly sorry for all his evil doings in life and that all he hoped for was to reconcile with God and to be graced with a good death  Seemingly in response  the man \' s stake broke  and with great effort and pain  he managed to  \'  \' de impale \'  \'  himself  Crawling along  he came to a house  and his cries of help were heard  He was helped into a bed  and a priest was sent for  The former robber chief then gave his death bed confession  grieving over his misspent life  but properly grateful to God and St  Barbara  He then died in peace  his hands folded over his chest  lt ref gt  \'  \' Vierholz \'  \'   1737   http   books google no books id jrY AAAAcAAJ amp pg PA493 p  amp nbsp 493   95  lt  ref gt  \n  \n Another incident  which was  allegedly  partially witnessed by the editor of a  quot Ladies \'  Journal quot   is said to have occurred in Wallachia in the 1770s  He had been present in   Arad  Romania Arad   when 27 robbers had been impaled  It was strictly forbidden to give the impaled persons any water  but one woman took mercy on one of the robbers  and fetched water for him in a kettle  As she was glancing anxiously about to check if anyone took notice of her forbidden act of mercy  the robber smashed her head in with the kettle  killing her on the spot  The editor avers he was present when the robber was asked why he had done such a thing  and he merely replied he had done it on a whim  and just had felt like killing her then and there  lt ref gt  \'  \' Damengesellschaft \'  \'   1785

preserved in which impalement occurs as a central element  A man became suspicious of his wife because she went out each day to gather roots and cedar bark but hardly ever brought anything home  One day  he spied on her  and discovered that she was cavorting with Lynx  rather than doing her wifely duties  The next day  he asked her to accompany her  and they went out in the forest  and came at last to a very tall tree  The man climbed to the top of it  the wife following  The jealous man then sharpened the top of the tree with his knife  and impaled his wife on it  On his way down  he removed the bark of the tree  so it became slick  The woman cried out her pain and her brothers heard her  They and animals they called to help them tried to rescue her  but the stem was too slick for them to climb up to reach her  Then Snail offered to help her  and slowly crawled up the tree  But alas  Snail moved too slowly  and by the time it took him to reach the top of the tree  the woman was dead  lt ref gt The brothers later on revenged themselves on the husband  through a clever ruse   \'  \' Teit \'  \'   1912   p  339   40 lt  ref gt  \n  \n Among tribes living around the   Titicaca    tales circulated in the sixteenth century that prior to the   Incas    a mysterious group of white men lived there  and their banishment was somehow connected with the birth of the Sun  A sixteenth century tale collected by a Spanish missionary tells of such an individual  called Tanupa or Taapac  who was impaled by other Indians around the Titicaca  and a shrine was set up there to commemorate the events  lt ref gt  \'  \' Bandelier \'  \'   1904   impalement incident at p 224 lt  ref gt  \n  \n    Martyrdom of al Hallaj    \n The renowned Sufi mystic was in AD 922 to be impaled for blasphemy in Baghdad  for having said such things as  quot I am God quot   However  the executioners were unable to do so  because al Hallaj floated in the air just above their reach  Then  al Hallaj \' s spirit ascended to Heaven  and conversed with Muhammed  the Prophet of Islam  and al Hallaj asked the Prophet if he should let himself be impaled  The Prophet acknowledged that al Hallaj \' s spiritual state was so heightened that his utterance  quot I am God quot  was both just and true  but that for the sake of ordinary people  he should let himself be impaled  because their spiritual state was such that they would be mislead from practical religion if they were to believe in such sayings like  quot I am God quot   And thus  for the sake of preserving the religion of ordinary people  al Hallaj let himself be impaled at last  lt ref gt Lit Soc  Bombay  1819    http   books google no books id 12soAAAAYAAJ amp pg PA111 p  111   113  lt  ref gt  \n  \n    Orientalism    \n Tales and anecdotes concerning how dreadfully swift and harsh Ottoman justice was for comparatively trivial offenses abound    Dimitrie Cantemir    a Moldavian noble living in Constantinople at the end of the 17th century  and often engaged in pleas of cases towards Ottoman authorities  narrates a tale from the building of a great mosque there in 1461  The Greek architect was amply rewarded by the sultan  so that a whole street was privileged to the Greek populace in recognition of his efforts  However  some asked the architect if he could even build a greater and more beautiful mosque than the one completed  Incautiously  the architect said sure enough  if I were given the materials  The sultan  upon hearing this  was so fearful that his successors might create an even more beautiful mosque than his own  that just in case  he chose to impale the architect to deprive successors of that genius  commemorating the event by erect a huge iron spike in the middle of the mosque  Not even bothering to refute this tale of impalement  Cantemir says that he  \'  \' does \'  \'   however  believe in the grand gift of the street  because he had used the original charter from the sultan to protect the Greek interest when somebody wanted to deprive the Greeks of the privilege  Cantemir won his case  lt ref gt  \'  \' Cantemir \'  \'   1734    http   books google no books id q3NUAAAAYAAJ

tobacco  the other for using it  lt ref gt  \'  \' Sherwood  Jones \'  \'   1825   http   books google no books jtp 722 amp id 8esTAAAAIAAJ p 722  lt  ref gt  Another such anecdote  illustrative of European ideas of  quot topsy turvy quot  Oriental governments with scant respect for rank and  quot proper quot  ways for the people to address the powers of the State is said to have occurred in 1695 under   Mustafa II    The Grand Vizier prevented access to the sultan to a poor shoemaker who had a petition for his sovereign  Once the sultan learnt of it  he promptly ordered the Grand Vizier

Gotham    bereft of common sense as a result of a curse laid upon them  In their last judgment  they had condemned two robbers to be impaled  but when the robbers began quarreling about who should get impaled on the longest pole  Bhava Chandra and his minister became deeply intrigued  The robbers told them that whoever died on the longest pole would be reincarnated as the ruler of the Earth  while the other would become his minister  Thinking it unseemly that two mere robbers should gain such a high position in their next life  Bhava Chandra chose to impale himself on the longest pole  while

Mandavya had stolen the goods  the authorities placed Mandavya on trial  He could not answer the judge on how the goods had come to be in his hermitage  so the king declared he was to be impaled  Mandavya seemed unperturbed by the whole affair  and when he was still alive  in deep contemplation  on the stake after 4 years  the king declared Mandavya had to be innocent  and ordered him pulled down  However  the stake broke inside Mandavya \' s body  and the excruciating pain destroyed Mandavya \' s trance  In deep bitterness  he asked the gods how he had deserved such a fate  and Yama answered it was because of the locust he had tortured as a young boy  Mandavya became infuriated at Yama and pointed out how disproportionate the punishment had been  He then cursed Yama to be born as

for 10 years  When the king was on his death bed  he was unwilling to let Samdhimati have the prophecy fulfilled  so he ordered Samdhimati impaled  When Samdhimati \' s guru Isana heard of this  he went to the cemetery where Samhimati was impaled in order to perform the proper funeral rites  The wolves had devoured all the flesh of the body  and Isana was amazed that the prophecy was inscribed on Samdhimati \' s skull that he was to inherit the kingdom  Keeping watch  one night Isana saw the graveyard was filled with   Yogini  s  female mystics witches   The Yoginis were drunk and  quot lustful for a man quot   and provided the skeleton with flesh  not the least  a penis  from their own bodies  They then captured Samdhimati \' s spirit  which was still hovering around  within the fleshed skeleton  and  quot spent the rest of the night sporting with him quot   As dawn approached  Isana  afraid that Samdhimati \' s new body should be dissolved by the witches  rushed out from his

to sing  with the accompaniment of some drums  and  during the music  the other dervises arose  took the sharp pointed irons  and did as if they were piercing their bodies  and even driving the irons with mallets into their flesh  Next appeared the principal actor  who  assuming an air of inspiration  directed the music to proceed  and to be raised to higher animation  in  order to assist his enthusiasm  or rather to stun the ears of the spectators  In his extacy  he threw up his turban in the air  loosened his hair  for this order of dervises wear their hair  and pierced his body with five lances  then mounting upon a low building  upon which a pole  sixteen feet long  and shod with a sharp iron point  had been set up  he impaled himself upon the pole  and was carried in this condition through the square  It was an affecting sight  to see a lean man  with a long beard  and dishevelled hair  wounded all over with spikes  and then carried about spitted upon a pole  I said  as I went away  to a Mullah of my acquaintance  that the dervise performed his tricks by means of a broad belt which he carried in his long wide drawers  The Mullah replied  that he had suspected some such art  but avoided mentioning his suspicions  lest he might draw upon himself the enmity of the order of   Sheikh Bedreddin Bed reddin    for that one of his brethren had experienced great

' \n   Decorative art as a trade commodity   \n  \n The trade commodities included in the definition of      visual art      include the following    painting    drawing    sculpture   in various materials    printmaking      photography    maps    performance art      installation art      mail art      assemblage art      textile arts      fashion design      video art      digital art    and product design  lt ref name  quot one quot    gt  These works are non functional  emotional  social  political  traditional  and cultural statements  and in comparison to other goods  are not greatly affected by commercial sector constraints  lt ref name  quot one quot    gt  Though visual art is a physical  hand made good  it is often culturally rooted and created for aesthetic appeal   Therefore  art is considered   intellectual property    lt ref name  quot one quot    gt  \n  \n The 4 digit   Standard International Trade Classification    SITC  classifies    Works of Art  Collectors Pieces and Antiques    under category 8960  which includes paintings  drawings  pastels  original sculptures  original prints  stamps  and antiques over 100 years old  This is the only SITC category that consists of unique  non reproducible art  which is typically thought of as    fine    art  lt ref name  quot two quot    gt  The 4 digit   Harmonized System harmonized commodity   description and coding system  otherwise known as the harmonized system  HS  code for    fine    art is 9701  which is classified as  quot Paintings  Drawings and Pastels  Executed Entirely By Hand  quot  lt ref name  quot three quot    gt  \n  \n   History of international art trade   \n  \n The earliest known regulation of cultural property dates to 1464  when   Pope Pius II   prohibited the exportation of works of art from the Papal States  lt ref name  quot four quot    gt  It wasn   t until the mid 1500s that any sizable amount of formal artwork was transferred between nations in licit markets   Previously  local demand had satisfied the supply of artwork  but it couldn   t keep up as the number of artists increased  lt ref name  quot five quot    gt   Consequently  artists exported their works to foreign markets   Between 1540 and 1670  an average of 144 paintings per year were transported between the   Netherlands   and   New Spain    lt ref name  quot five quot    gt  \n  \n Throughout much of the   early modern period    if an artist could not domestically sell his art  he sold it instead to dealers who exported the works abroad   Starting in the 17th Century  however  most art was traded at the massive auction houses of   Christie \' s   and   Sotheby \' s   of London  which both still survive today  lt ref name  quot five quot    gt  \n  \n Like any other traded good  art has been historically subjected to import duties   For example  in the more enlightened years of the 19th Century  art escaped high tariffs in America because the government viewed art as an important cultural good    At other times  though  tariff revenue was considered more important than free intellectual property  lt ref name  quot six quot    gt  \n  \n   class  quot wikitable quot  \n   Highlights of Official Treatments of Imported Paintings and Sculpture in the USA  1789 1865 lt ref name  quot six quot    gt  \n    \n   Year    Duty        Context of change  exemptions \n    \n   1789    5     \n    \n   1790    10    A general increase in duties was prompted by revenue requirements \n    \n   1800    12 5    Upward revisions were made to    defray expenses in relation to the Barbary States     \n    \n   1812    30    Duties were more than doubled to finance the war with Britain \n    \n   1816    15    Imports of    any society incorporated for philosophical or literary purposes or for the encouragement of the fine arts    were placed on the free list  \n    \n   1824    15    Protectionist pressures generated advances in duties  overall  but duties on imported art were not changed  \n    \n   1832    0      Tariff Act of 1832    All paintings and sculpture were placed on the free list  \n    \n   1841   1842    20    Overall increase in rates was driven by needs of an empty Treasury   Though art duties were re imposed  the    productions of American artists residing abroad    were added to the free list  along with imports of nonprofit cultural institutions  \n    \n   1846    0    All paintings entered free when imported as an object of taste and not of merchandise  \n    \n   1861    10    The requirements of the Civil War finance elevated overall rates  \n    \n  \n During   World War II    neutral   Switzerland   became the primary trafficker of art on the European continent   Most    degenerate    works of art that the   Nazi   government purged from German museums were sold there  where they largely entered   black markets     Since the war ended  there has been a massive  ongoing effort to recover all of these works   For fifteen years following the war  45 000 pieces were returned to France  mostly to Jewish owners  lt ref name  quot seven quot    gt  \n  \n Today  almost every country in the world has restrictions and regulations on the export of cultural property  lt ref name  quot four quot    gt   Currently  most art auctions are facilitated on online sites such as   eBay   and  http   Lauritz com  Lauritz com   lt ref name  quot five quot    gt  \n  \n   Economic theory of art trade   \n  \n Fine art proves complicated for economists to analyze  mostly because trade in unique art is in large part trade between consumers     the    secondary market        rather than the    primary market    trade between the producer  artist  and the consumer  lt ref name  quot two quot    gt   For example  when a museum buys a sculpture from a private collector  the exchange is between two consumers and considered a transaction in the secondary market because neither of them produced the sculpture   It is more complicated for economists  then  to capture these transactions in their data  lt ref name  quot two quot    gt  \n  \n   Comparative advantage   is also more difficult to pinpoint in the case of cultural goods    There is a certain degree of cultural nationalism of art  lt ref name  quot eight quot    gt  making some nations reluctant to part with their cultural property   Additionally  relative advantage cannot simply be calculated by the   marginal cost   of producing a unit of art  since aesthetic value plays so heavily into its price  lt ref name  quot two quot    gt  \n  \n Trade theory demonstrates how much and at what price countries trade goods if they have different endowments or different preferences   But this model is not very useful because of retentive nationalism  lt ref name  quot nine quot    gt  a country that is relatively less endowed with art producing resources will not stop producing simply because they can import art from abroad at cheaper prices  lt ref name  quot two quot    gt  \n  \n    Determination of prices    \n  \n Traditional trade theory treats art as a homogenous  non differentiated good  which is where it fails to reliably predict trade trends  lt ref name  quot two quot    gt  Unique art is valued precisely because of its uniqueness   Since each piece of art is different  and because each piece does not appear on the market very often  the determination of changes in market value prove difficult to determine  lt ref name  quot two quot    gt  \n  \n Economists use the   hedonic regression    HR  estimation method to calculate prices in art   This is used to predict prices based on various attributes of the artwork such as its dimensions  the artist  and the subject matter attended to  lt ref name  quot ten quot    gt  \n  \n   Protectionism vs  Liberalization   \n   \n   Protectionism   is a nationalistic viewpoint that contends that a healthy cultural industry is necessary to assert national sovereignty and identity  lt ref name  quot eleven quot    gt   Countries with small domestic markets are often overwhelmed by imports from larger markets in which producers can make up their costs of production by dumping content abroad   America is the largest exporter of artwork in the world  and English speaking countries are especially vulnerable to American imports  lt ref name  quot three quot    gt  Protectionists view this as a modern form of American   imperialism    which reduces cultural diversity when national industries are unable to compete  lt ref name  quot eleven quot    gt  \n  \n Protectionism is less concerned with direct economic interest as it is with preserving cultural integrity   Australian economist   David Throsby   argues that investment in    cultural capital    may be necessary for the sustainability of a culture  lt ref name  quot twelve quot    gt    Paul M  Bator    who helped negotiate and draft the   UNESCO   convention on the International Trade of Art  argues that larger countries are responsible for the cultural interests of smaller ones   He explains in  \'  \' The International Trade in Art \'  \'  that    art rich countries should create tax and other financial and psychological incentives to persuade those with important antiquities and archaeological objects to keep them at home     lt ref name  quot four quot    gt  \n  \n  \n Proponents of   Economic liberalization liberalization   in international art markets stress that open markets contribute to efficient production and distribution of cultural products  lt ref name  quot eleven quot    gt  Reliance on competitive market forces also frees creative individuals from the hindrance of government oversight  lt ref name  quot eleven quot    gt    Many special characteristics of cultural products     the lack of rivalry in content    economies of scale    and   economies of agglomeration agglomeration economies       enhance the case for opening markets   Protection raises rather than lowers domestic prices  which detracts from consumer welfare  lt ref name  quot eleven quot    gt  \n  \n The      commodification   objection    is the reluctance to classify an important cultural good as a simple trade commodity  and is frequently cited by cultural protectionists  lt ref name  quot nine quot    gt   Those who advocate openness believe that free market nations can provide the most effective political force for development of an active market   This argument diametrically opposes Bator   s  free trade advocates contend that large countries are better suited to help smaller nations finance organization of their cultural resources for more effective participation in international trade  lt ref name  quot eleven quot    gt  \n  \n The issue of the illicit art trade also factors into the debate   In terms of value transferred  the illegal trafficking of art ranks in black market activities second only to narcotics  lt ref name  quot thirteeen quot    gt  More problematic than the actual theft of the work is its subsequent transport  which proves difficult to prosecute since most paintings are easily concealable  By maintaining an open market  liberalists argue that much of the illicit trade of art can be eliminated  lt ref name  quot nine quot    gt  \n  \n   Largest countries by total trade in art   \n  \n The following tables list the top world import export values  according to data from the UN Comtrade database using SITC code 8960   The sums here are greater than those included in HS 9701  works done exclusively by hand  because the SITC classification includes works such as antiques  stamps  and sculpture that aren   t captured in the HS definition  lt ref name  quot three quot    gt  \n  \n    class  quot

characterized   Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart Mozart \' s   various works in imitation of   Baroque music Baroque   style as pastiche  and   Edvard Grieg   \' s   Holberg Suite   was written as a conscious

Pastiche can also be a   Cinematic techniques cinematic   device wherein the creator of the film pays   Homage  arts  homage   to another filmmaker \' s style and use of   cinematography    including camera angles    lighting    and   mise en sc  ne    A film \' s writer may also offer a pastiche based on the works of other writers  this is especially evident in historical films and   documentaries   but can be found in   non fiction     drama      comedy   and   Horror film horror   films as well   A major filmmaker    Quentin Tarantino   often uses various plots  characteristics and themes from many lesser known films to create his films  He has even openly stated that he  quot steals from everyone quot   \n  \n     Architecture     \n In   urban planning     quot pastiche quot  is used to describe developments as imitations of the building styles created by major architects  the implication is that the work is unoriginal and of little merit  and the term is generally attributed without reference to its urban context  Many post war European developments can in this way be described as pastiches of the work of architects and planners such as   Le Corbusier   or   Ebenezer Howard      Alain de Botton   describes pastiche as  quot an unconvincing reproduction of the styles of the past quot   lt ref gt  http   www channel4 com 4homes architecture architecture news views alain de botton on architecture 08 05 27 p 1 html Alain de Botton on architecture  lt  ref gt  \n  \n However the term  \' pastiche \'  in the architectural and urban context is problematic due to the historical reliance on evolving design traditions in architecture and urban design   Therefore work that shows an evolution of an existing design tradition may embody elements typical of that style   For instance classical architecture recurred and evolved over several millennia without being referred to as pastiche  though basic compositional elements recurred   Similarly  in historic centres where the coherence of the urban environment is paramount  infill buildings have over time adopted the design traditions of the setting and in that sense might be seen as imitative   The term  \' pastiche \'  in architectural criticism should therefore be more precisely associated with an idea from the modernism  that design characteristics of the modernist style would fully supersede and replace earlier design traditions  which were seen as regressive   The use of the word  \' pastiche \'  was developed by proponents of modernism to dismiss contemporary work that sought to adopt and evolve pre modernist design traditions   citation needed date April 2014   \n  \n    Mass  music     \n A  \'  \'  \' pastiche Mass \'  \'  \'  is a   Mass  music  Mass   where the

Beethoven   and the  \'  \'   Messe de Nostre Dame   \'  \'  by   Guillaume de Machaut    In a pastiche Mass  the performers may choose a Kyrie from one composer  and a Gloria from another  or  choose

through or on an accessible medium so that anyone can view  hear or experience it  The act itself of producing an expression can also be referred to as a certain art  or as art in general  \n  \n If this solidified expression  or the act of producing it  is  \' good \'  or worth anything depends on those who access and rate it and this public rating is dependent on various subjective factors  \n

Byzantine   and   Gothic art   of the   Middle Ages    the dominance of the church insisted on the expression of biblical and not material truths  \n  \n Eastern art has generally worked in a style akin to Western medieval art  namely a concentration on surface patterning and local colour  meaning the plain colour of an object  such as basic red for a red robe  rather than the modulations of that colour brought about by light  shade and reflection   A characteristic of this style is that the local colour is often defined by an outline  a contemporary equivalent is the cartoon   This is evident in  for example  the art of   India      Tibet   and   Japan    \n  \n Religious   Islam  ic art forbids iconography  and expresses religious ideas through geometry instead  \n  \n The

image    using any of a wide variety of tools and techniques  It generally involves making marks on a surface by applying pressure from a tool  or moving a tool across a surface  Common tools are

manifest the expressive and conceptual intention of the practitioner  Painting is also used to express spiritual motifs and ideas  sites of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery to   Sistine Chapel The Sistine Chapel   to the human body itself  \n  \n   Colour   is the essence of painting as   sound   is of   music    Colour is highly subjective  but has observable psychological effects  although these can differ from one culture to the next  Black is associated with mourning in the West  but elsewhere white may be  Some painters  theoreticians  writers and scientists  including   Goethe      Wassily Kandinsky Kandinsky      Isaac Newton Newton    have written their own   colour theory    Moreover  the use of language is only an abstraction for a colour equivalent  The word  quot   red   quot   for example  can cover a wide range of variations on the pure red of the spectrum  There is not a formalized register of different colours in the way that there is agreement on different   note  s in music  such as C or C   although the   Pantone   system is widely used in the printing and design industry for this purpose  \n  \n Modern artists have extended the practice of painting considerably to include  for example    collage    This began with   Cubism   and is not painting in strict sense  Some modern painters

\n  \n Modern and contemporary art has moved away from the historic value of craft in favour of   concept    this has led some to say that painting  as a serious art form  is dead  although this has not deterred the majority of artists from continuing to practise it either as whole or part of their work  \n  \n    Photography    \n   Main Fine art photography   \n  \n Photography as an art form

of an architect range from the more complex  such as for a   hospital   or a   stadium    to the apparently simpler  such as planning   residential   houses  Many architectural works may be seen also as cultural and political   symbol  s  and or works of art  The role of the architect  though changing  has been central to the successful  and sometimes less than successful  design and

India \' s poor   \n  \n  \'  \'  \' Public speaking \'  \'  \'  is the process and act of   Speech communication speaking   or giving a lecture to a group of people in a structured  deliberate manner intended to inform  influence  or entertain a listening audience  Public speaking is commonly understood as face to face speaking between individuals and an audience for the purpose of communication  It is closely allied to  quot presenting quot   although the latter is more often associated with commercial activity  Most of the time  public speaking is to persuade the audience  \n  \n   Overview   \n In public speaking  as in any form of communication  there are five basic elements  often expressed as  quot  \'  \' who \'  \'  is saying  \'  \' what \'  \'  to  \'  \' whom \'  \'  using what  \'  \' medium \'  \'  with what  \'  \' effects \'  \'   quot  The purpose of public speaking can range from simply transmitting information  to motivating people to act  to simply telling a   Short story story    Good orators should be able to change the emotions of their listeners  not just inform them  Public speaking can also be considered a   discourse community      Interpersonal communication   and public speaking have several components that embrace such things as motivational speaking  leadership personal development  business  customer service  large group communication  and mass communication  Public speaking can be a powerful tool to use for purposes such as motivation  influence  persuasion  informing  translation  or simply    ethos    lt ref gt Zakahi  Walter

Egypt  \n    \n  lt  ref gt  \n The first known Greek work  specify date January 2011   on oratory  written over 2000 years ago  elaborated principles drawn from the practices and experience of orators in the   ancient Greece ancient Greek   city states  In classical   Ancient Greece Greece   and   Ancient Rome Rome    the main component was   rhetoric    that is  composition and delivery of speeches   and was an important skill in public and private life    Aristotle   and   Quintilian   discussed oratory  and the subject  with definitive rules and models  was emphasised as a part of a   liberal arts   education during the   Middle Ages   and   Renaissance    \n  \n The art of public speaking was first developed  citation needed date December 2011   by the ancient Greeks  Greek oration is known from the works of   classical antiquity    Greek orators spoke  on their own behalf rather as representatives of either a client or a   constituency    and so any   citizen   who wished to succeed in court  in politics  or in social life had to learn techniques of public speaking  These skills were taught first by a group of self styled  quot   sophists   quot  who were known to charge fees  to  quot make the weaker argument the stronger  quot  and to make their students  quot better quot  through instruction in excellence    Plato      Aristotle    and   Socrates   all developed theories of public speaking in opposition to the Sophists  and their ideas took on institutional form through the development of permanent schools where public speaking was taught  Though Greece eventually lost political sovereignty  the Greek culture of training in public speaking was adopted virtually wholesale by the Romans  \n  \n With the political rise of the   Roman Republic    Roman orators copied and modified Greek techniques of public speaking  Under Roman influence  instruction in rhetoric developed into a full curriculum including instruction in grammar  study of the poets   preliminary exercises    progymnasmata     and preparation of public speeches  declamation  in both forensic and deliberative genres  The Latin style was heavily influenced by   Cicero    and involved a strong emphasis on a broad education in all areas of humanistic study  in the liberal arts  including philosophy   as well as on the use of wit and humor  on appeal to the listener \' s emotions  and on digressions  often used to explore general themes related to the specific topic of the speech   Oratory in the   Roman empire    though less central to political life than in the days of the Republic  remained important in law  and became  under the second Sophistic  an important form of entertainment  with famous orators or declaimers gaining great wealth and prestige for their skills  \n  \n This Latin style was the primary form of oration in the world until the beginning of the 20th century  After   World War II   there began a gradual deprecation of the Latin style of oration  With the rise of the   scientific method   and the emphasis on a  quot plain quot  style of speaking and writing  even formal oratory has become less polished and ornate than in the Classical period  though politicians today can still make or break their careers on the basis of a successful  or unsuccessful  speech    Abraham Lincoln      Adolf Hitler      Marcus Garvey      John F  Kennedy      Bill Clinton    and   Barack Obama   all advanced their careers in significant part by their skills in oratory   citation needed date January 2011   \n  \n These basic principles have undergone modification as   societies   and   culture  s have changed  yet remained surprisingly uniform   The technology and the methods of this form of   communication   have traditionally been through   oratory   structure and rely on an audience  However  new advances in technology have allowed for more sophisticated communication for speakers and public orators  The technological and media sources that assist the public speaking atmosphere include both   videoconferencing   and telecommunications    Videoconferencing   is among one of the more recent technologies that is in a way revolutionizing the way that public speakers communicate to the masses  David M  Fetterman of   Stanford University   wrote in his 1997 article  \'  \' Videoconferencing over the Internet \'  \'    quot   Videoconferencing   technology allows geographically disparate parties to hear and see each other usually through satellite or telephone   communication   systems quot   This technology is helpful for large conference meetings and face to face communication contexts  and is becoming more widespread across the world   citation needed date December 2011   \n  \n   Training and Education

it is easier for the media and   advocacy group interest groups   to inform voters if elected officials are following through on their campaign promises because politicians are forced to take more distinct stances on policy issues  lt ref name epstein 07  gt  lt ref name mutz 06  gt  Thus  polarization can facilitate the elucidation of political actions and then help or harm representatives who do not follow through on their undertakings  lt ref name epstein 07  gt  This increases accountability of politicians to voters  but it can also be detrimental since in some circumstances it is more important for politicians to focus on unexpected or long standing issues instead of their campaign promises  lt ref name epstein 07  gt  Overall     it is generally considered healthy for a democracy to hold officials accountable for pledges they make in election campaigns     lt ref name epstein 07  gt   \n  \n Similarly  some scholars have argued that a positive consequence of polarization is that it leads to strong and definitive political parties that offer explicit platforms and messages to voters  lt ref name epstein 07  gt  lt ref name dodson 10  gt  Giving voters more distinct choices leads to more participation through voting  working on campaigns  expressing opinions to representatives and giving to candidates or particular causes  lt ref name epstein 07  gt  lt ref name

personal attributes and voters are more likely to cast policy oriented ballots  lt ref name layman 06  gt  lt ref name epstein 07  gt  Therefore  some political scientists have found that    the rise

legitimacy of the judicial branch  lt ref name galston 06  gt  lt ref name binder 00  gt  Political polarization causes support for nominees to come predominantly from the President   s party  which

 the public interest is by definition enhanced whenever that change is preferred to the status quo ex ante  This approach is  quot ex ante quot   in the sense that the change is not evaluated after the fact but assessed before the fact without knowing whether one would actually benefit or suffer from it  \n  \n This approach follows the  quot veil of ignorance quot  approach  which was first

Brandeis  center  in his office 1916    \n    Public interest law    is a term that became widely adopted in the United States during and after the social turmoil of the 1960s  It built upon a tradition exemplified by   Louis Brandeis    who before becoming a U S  Supreme Court justice incorporated advocacy for the interests of the general public into his legal practice   \n In a celebrated 1905 speech  Brandeis decried the legal profession  complaining that    able lawyers have to a large extent allowed themselves to become adjuncts of great corporations and have neglected their

' lt    Please DO NOT change the spelling of  quot organisation quot  to  quot organization quot   See   Wikipedia Manual of Style National varieties of English      gt  \n A  \'  \'  \' political faction \'  \'  \'  is a group of individuals  such as a   political party    a   trade union    or other group with a common political purpose  A faction or political party may include fragmented sub factions     parties within a party  quot  which may be referred to as power blocs  or voting blocs   Members of factions band together as a way of achieving these goals and advancing their agenda and position within an organization  \n  \n Factions are not limited to political parties  they can and frequently do form within any group that has some sort of political aim or purpose  \n  \n   Etymology and usage   \n The Latin word  \'  \' factio \'  \'  denoted originally either of the   Chariot Rome chariot   teams that were organised professionally by private companies in ancient Rome  each recognizable by characteristic colour and arousing supporter hysteria similar to that in modern sports fans  These teams were not unlike    gladiator school  s  but the lethal nature of that entertainment meant few performers lasted long enough to build up similar crowd loyalty to the  quot team quot   while the fighters rarely actually teamed up  but rather fought duels or beasts  In time  political currents could become associated with such a team  although precisely how this happened is unclear   In   Constantinople Byzantine Constantinople    two such chariot factions  blue and green  repeatedly made or broke the claims of candidates to the imperial throne  \n  \n Occasionally  the term  quot faction quot  is still used more or less as a synonym for   political party    but  quot with opprobrious sense  conveying the imputation of selfish or mischievous ends or turbulent or unscrupulous methods quot   according to the  \'  \'   Oxford English Dictionary   \'  \'    In his Dictionary    Samuel Johnson    a   Tory  British political party  Tory    dismissively defined   Whigs  British political party  Whig   as  quot the name of a faction quot   Similarly  in the   Federalist No  10 tenth installment   of the   Federalist Papers      James Madison   defines a faction as  quot a number of citizens  whether amounting to a minority or majority of the whole  who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion  or of interest  adverse to the rights of other citizens  or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community  quot   In plain English this is a group that pursues self interest at the expense of the common good  \n  \n   Aims of factions   \n The aims of a political faction are as diverse as the different types of bodies within which they appear  Typically  however  they include  advancing a particular   policy   or policy agenda  preventing the adoption of alternative policies and supporting given individuals to positions of power within the organization or in the wider political world   A faction can primarily be based around supporting a given person or group  or a single major aim  with little in the way of common agenda otherwise  or it can have a comprehensive and definitive set of policies   Either way  factional politics typically revolve around personality  with a few individuals playing key roles  acting as a magnet for like minded people  leading the activities of the faction  and acting as a prominent voice for the shared objectives of the faction  Such individuals can be referred to by a variety of names  such as    powerbrokers    or    factional chiefs     \n  \n   Organization   \n  lt    Please DO NOT change the spelling of  quot organisation quot  to  quot organization quot   See   Wikipedia Manual of Style National varieties of English      gt  \n Factions differ in the amount of organisation and internal structure they possess  On the left  these may take the form of   multi tendency tendencies   or   platform  European politics  platforms    Most factions are very loose organisations  having no definitive list of members  but some factions  have a formal internal structure  with membership lists  regular meetings  official positions  amp ndash  such as negotiators  conveners    whip  politics  whips    and organizers   amp ndash  and a definitive policy position on every issue affecting the broader organisation  Such factions will typically be binding  that is  they rely upon all members casting their votes in accordance with the pre ordained official stance of the faction  \n  \n   Operation of factions   \n In political organisations that are   democratic   in structure  factions rely heavily on securing enough votes to win important ballots  This process is sometimes referred to as    doing the numbers     Having the numbers will allow the faction to push policies it supports and elect its members to powerful positions within the broader organisation  \n  \n If one faction develops within an organisation  there will usually be at least one other that develops in opposition to it  Opposing factions will try to match each other \' s level of organisation and internal discipline  but will also engage in negotiations and trade offs to ensure that the organisation   s activities are not compromised and that every group has a chance to obtain at least some of its goals  \n  \n Key to the operation of an organised faction is the existence of a power base  This will typically be some office  division or branch of the broader organisation over which the faction has effective control  Sometimes a power base may be an external or affiliated organisation that is involved with the broader organisation in some way  \n  \n A power base serves several key functions  \n  It acts as a recruitment center for new members  and promotes homogeneity within the membership  crucial for maintaining factional cohesion   \n  It can be used as an organising center for factional events and activities  \n  It functions as a springboard  advancing the career of selected factional members and allowing them to gain skills that will increase their effectiveness and clout  \n  \n   Effects of factions   \n The existence of a factional system can have serious negative consequences for a political organisation   If factional strife becomes intensive and public  the organisation may suffer from perceptions of disunity  Taken one step further  if the conflict is particularly severe  it may cause ruptures within the organisation that seriously impede its effectiveness  leading to break up or collapse of the organisation  \n  \n To avoid harm to the organisation  factional operations are usually conducted under strong secrecy and with minimal public scrutiny  This  however  can lead to the proliferation of unethical behaviour  Warfare between the factions may lead to tactics such as ballot box stuffing  stack outs  membership fraud  and other generally fraudulent conduct  Individuals who abandon a faction may be subject to intense personal   Feud vendetta  s where their former comrades go about sabotaging their careers   A climate of intense factional conflict can also motivate individuals to focus on attacking their factional enemies rather than furthering the broader organisation  \n  \n Despite this  the benefits of factional systems are often overlooked  It is often incomprehensible to outsiders why members of a broader organisation would engage in factionalism  This stems from the assumption that the natural factional relationship is one of conflict and strife  when in fact  factions are often able to engage in productive co operation  \n  \n In any political organization there are likely to be many highly opinionated and passionate people  The existence of a factional system allows its operations to be more predictable and stable  Compromise and give and take between factions allows the organisation to operate without having to satisfy the whims of many different  uncompromising individuals who might otherwise cause a split  So  somewhat counter intuitively  factionalism can actually promote organisational harmony  \n  \n Factions also help to broaden and diversify the organisation   s appeal  A person who might otherwise find the organisation   s goals unattractive might be persuaded to support a faction within it whose goals are closer to their own  Just as a democratic   government   is often invigorated by a strong   Parliamentary Opposition opposition    so having a number of distinct points of view with an organisation can energise it and allow it to perform its role more effectively  It is also highly unlikely that any sizeable political organisation is wholly united in purpose  so arguably factions simply represent a way of managing pre existing differences within the organisation  \n  \n The Founding Fathers of the American constitution  explicitly warned against the dangers of party factionalism  Madison  Hamilton  and Washington expressed the belief that factions would create divides that would ultimately dismantle the government  These sentiments can be found the The Federalist Papers  specifically Federalist 10 and 51 written by Madison  \n  \n   See also   \n    Infighting   \n    Ley de Lemas   \n    Partisan  political    \n  \n

and support intellectuals who largely focused their talents on rabbinical studies   Johnson asserts that  quot quite suddenly  around the year 1800  this ancient and highly efficient social machine for the production of intellectuals began to shift its output  Instead of pouring all its products into the closed circuit of rabbinical studies        it unleashed a significant and ever growing proportion of them into secular life  This was an event of shattering importance in world history  quot  lt ref gt   cite book  title A History of the Jews  first Paul  last Johnson  year 1988  pages 340   341   lt  ref gt  \n  \n The French Revolution of 1789 promised equality  freedom  and an end to discrimination for all including the Jews  The subsequent political emancipation of the Jews in most of Western and Central Europe provoked an anti modern and specifically anti Jewish backlash from traditional conservative groupings  In response  Jews allied themselves with the modern liberalist forces  and played an important role in the 1848 European revolutions which sought to entrench the gains of liberalism  However  the ensuing failure of liberalism to protect Jewish rights led many Jews to seek new allies within the growing working class movement  The international character of the socialist movement seemingly offered Jews protection from old religious and national hatreds  Thus in contrast to most other national groups  Jews had a double reason to join the proletarian revolution  They were discriminated against both on class grounds and on racial grounds   fact date October 2013    \n  \n Not surprisingly  many Jews made a rational decision to join a movement which promised to defend and extend the equal rights granted by the French Revolution  The prominence of Jews in the Left can  therefore  be attributed to reasons of self interest as much as to any idealistic motivation  Equally  the subsequent decline of Jewish involvement in the Left can be attributed to relatively objective factors such as the creation of the State of Israel which transformed Jewish dependence from international to national forces   fact date October 2013   \n  \n   20th century   \n Many young Jews rejected the Orthodoxy of their parents and turned to the great Jewish secular movements of Zionism  socialism  and   Bundism    a Jewish labor movement founded in Eastern Europe in the 19th century   They viewed their parents \'  faith in the eventual coming of the Messiah as a dangerous passivity in the face of imminent danger to the Jewish people  They took their fate into their own hands and created new forms of secular Jewish messianic activity  Their concern for changing the world by rejecting their religious background shows how deeply they were immersed in the Jewish search for redemption   fact date October 2013   \n  \n    Jewish Bolshevism    \n A persistent theme among critics of Jews   particularly those on the pre World War II right   has been that the   Bolshevik   revolution was a Jewish revolution and that the Soviet Union was dominated by Jews  This theme appears in a wide range of writings  from Henry Ford \' s International Jew  to published statements by a long list of British  French  and American political figures in the 1920s  Sir   Winston Churchill      Woodrow Wilson    and   David Lloyd George     and  in its most extreme form  by   Adolf Hitler    who wrote  \n  lt blockquote gt  \n  quot Now begins the last great revolution  By wresting political power for himself  the Jew casts off the few remaining shreds of disguise he still wears  The democratic plebeian Jew turns into the blood Jew and the tyrant of peoples  In a few years he will try to exterminate the national pillars of intelligence and  by robbing the peoples of their natural spiritual leadership  will make them ripe for the slavish lot of a permanent subjugation  The most terrible example of this is Russia  quot  \n  lt  blockquote gt  \n  \n This long tradition stands in sharp contradiction to the consensus view  held by Jewish organizations and almost all contemporary historians  that Jews played no special role in Bolshevism and indeed were specifically victimized by it   fact date October 2013   \n  \n   See also   \n    History of antisemitism   \n    Jewish Bolshevism   \n  \n    References    \n   reflist   \n  \n  \n

' \n   Definition by the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering   \n There is no global definition of a PEP  Most countries have based their definition on the   Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering    FATF  definition   cn date May 2014   \n  current or former senior official in the executive  legislative  administrative  military  or judicial branch of a foreign government  elected or not  \n  a senior official of a major foreign political party \n  a senior executive of a foreign government owned commercial enterprise  being a corporation  business or other entity formed by or for the benefit of any such individual \n  an immediate family member of such individual  meaning spouse  parents  siblings  children  and spouse \' s parents or siblings \n  any individual publicly known  or actually known by the relevant financial institution  to be a close personal or professional associate  \n The FATF definition is not intended to include middle ranking or more junior individuals    \n  \n As of February 2012  the FATF definition of a PEP was revised to include domestic PEPs  bringing the number of PEP types to three     a foreign PEP  a domestic PEP and a person who is a senior member of an international organization  lt ref gt  http   www fatf gafi org media fatf documents recommendations pdfs FATF Recommendations pdf lt  ref gt  \n Most FATF member countries treat domestic and foreign PEPs with heightened scrutiny    \n The distinction between a foreign and domestic PEP is problematic  because a person can be a foreign PEP everywhere in the world except in their own country  For example  China \' s President and General Secretary of the Communist Party  is a PEP everywhere except in China  The same is true for Canada \' s Prime Minister  In order to address this artificial distinction  the FATF Guidance says that if a person is a foreign PEP  that  \'  \' de facto \'  \'  makes them a domestic PEP in their own country  Logically  this makes sense for crime prevention purposes because in order to export proceeds of crime  the PEP must first use their own domestic financial system and thus  more importance should be placed on domestic  and non foreign PEPs  lt ref name  quot Ukraine Crisis quot  gt   cite web  last Duhaime  first Christine  title The  70 Billion Missing From the Ukraine  Does it Demonstrate a

of an object  be it material or intellectual  A right is a power enforced by public trust  Sometimes it happens that the exercise of a right is opposed to public trust  Nevertheless  a right is really an institution brought around by public trust  past  present or future  The growth of knowledge is the key to the history of property as an institution  The more man becomes knowledgeable of an object be it physical or intellectual  the more it is appropriated  The appearance of the State brought about the final stage in the evolution of property from wildlife to husbandry  In the presence of the State  man can hold landed property  The State began granting lordships and ended up conferring property and with it came   inheritance    With landed property came rent and in the exchange of goods  profit  so that in modern times  the  quot lord of the land quot  of long ago becomes the landlord  If it is wrongly assumed that the value of land is always the same  then there is of course no evolution of property whatever  However  the price of land goes up with every increase in population benefiting the landlord  The landlordism of large land owners has been the most rewarded of all political services  In industry  the position of the landlord is less important but in towns which have grown out of an industry  the fortunate landlord has reaped an enormous profit  Towards the

very striking evidence of the superiority of the royal courts over the feudal and popular courts in the matter of official skill is the fact that  until comparatively late in history  the royal courts alone kept written records of their proceedings  The   trial by jury   was adopted by the Royal Courts  securing its popularity and making it a bulwark of liberty  By the time of the   Protestant

own laws and nations like France  Germany  Spain and other countries had no national law until the end of the 18th century  was brought to an end by three great agencies that helped to create the modern system of law and legislation   Citation needed date January 2011   \n  \n    \'  \'  \' Records  \'  \'  \'  From the early Middle Ages in Europe there come what are called folk laws and they appear exactly at the time when the patriarchal was becoming the State  They are due almost universally to one cause  the desire of the king to know the custom of his subjects  These are not legislation in the sense of law making but statements or declarations of custom  They are drawn from a knowledge of the custom of the people  Unwritten custom changes imperceptibly but not the written  It is always possible to point to the exact text and show what it says  Nevertheless  the written text can change by addition with every new edition  \n    \'  \'  \' Law Courts  \'  \'  \'  By taking some general rule which seemed to be common to all the communities and ignoring the differences  English common law was modeled after such a practice so that the law became common in all the districts of the kingdom  The reason why in the rest of Europe  there was no common law till centuries later is because the State in those countries did not get hold of the administration of justice when England did  One of the shrewdest moves by which the English judges pushed their plan of making a common law was by limiting the verdict of the jury in every case to   questions of fact    At first the jury used to give answers both on law and fact  and being a purely local body  they followed local custom  A famous division came to pass  the province of the judge and the province of the jury  \n    \'  \'  \' Fictions  \'  \'  \'  Records and Law Courts were valuable in helping the people adapt to law making but like Fictions  they were slow and imperfect  Though slowly  Fictions work because it is a well known fact that people will accept a change in the form of a fiction while they would resist it to the end if the fact is out in the open  \n  \n Finally there is the enactment of laws or legislation  When progress and development is rapid  the faster method of   political representation   is adopted  This method does not originate in primitive society but in the State \' s need for money and its use of an assembly to raise the same  From the town assembly  a national assembly and the progress of commerce sprang   parliament  s all over Europe around the end of the 12th century  but not entirely representative or homogeneous for the nobility and the clergy  The clergy had amassed a fortune in land  about one fifth of all Christendom but at the time  in the 12th and 13th centuries  the Church was following a policy of isolation  they adopted the rule of   celibacy   and cut themselves from domestic life  they refused to plead in a secular court  they refused to pay taxes to the State on the grounds that they had already paid it to the   Pope    Since the main object of the king in holding a national assembly was to collect money  the Church could not be left out and so they came to Parliament  The Church did not like it but in most cases they had to come   Citation needed date January 2011   \n  \n The medieval Parliament was complete when it represented all the states in the realm  nobles  clergy  peasants and craftsmen but it was not a popular institution mainly because it meant   taxation    Only by the strongest pressure of the Crown were Parliaments maintained during the first century of their existence and the best proof of this assertion lies in the fact that in those countries where the Crown was weak  Parliament ceased to exist  The notion that parliaments were the result of a democratic movement cannot be supported by historical facts  Originally  the representative side of Parliament was solely concerned with money  representation in Parliament was a liability rather than a privilege  It is not uncommon that an institution created for one purpose begins to serve another  People who were asked to contribute with large sums of money began to   petition    Pretty soon  sessions in Parliament would turn into bargaining tables  the king granting petitions in exchange for money  However  there were two kinds of petitions  one private and the other public and it was from this last that laws were adopted or   legislation   originated  The king as head of State could give orders to preserve territorial integrity but not until these royal enactments were combined with public petition that successful legislation ever took place  Even to the present day  this has always been the basis of all successful legislation  public custom is adopted and enforced by the State   Citation needed date January 2011   \n  \n In the early days of political representation  the   majority   did not necessarily carry the day and there was very little need for contested   election  s but by the beginning of the 15th century  a seat in Parliament was something to be cherished  Historically speaking  the dogma of the equality of man is the result of the adoption of the purely practical machinery of the majority  but the adoption of the majority principle is also responsible for another institution of modern times  the   party system    The party system is an elaborate piece of machinery that pits at least two political candidates against each other for the vote of an electorate  its advantage being equal representation interesting a large number of people in politics  it provides effective criticism of the government in power and it affords an outlet for the ambition of a large number of wealthy and

primitive society    lt  ref gt  \n  \n      The state and the executive system      \n  \n The administration is one of the most difficult aspects of government  In the enactment and enforcement of laws  the victory of the State is complete but not so in regards to administration     the reason being that it is easy to see the advantage of the enactment and enforcement of laws but not the administration of domestic  religious and business affairs which should be kept to a minimum by government   Citation needed date January 2011   \n  \n Originally  the state was a military institution  For many years  it was just a territory ruled by a king who was surrounded by a small elite group of warriors and court officials and it was basically rule by force over a larger mass of people  Slowly  however  the people gained political representation for none can really be said to be a member of the State without the right of having a voice in the direction of policy making  One of the basic functions of the State in regards to administration is maintaining peace and internal order  it has no other excuse for interfering in the lives of its citizens  To maintain law and order the State develops means of   communication    Historically  the  quot king \' s highway quot  was laid down and maintained for the convenience of the royal armies not as an incentive to   commerce    In almost all countries  the State maintains the control of the means of communication and special freedoms such as those delineated in the   First Amendment to the United States Constitution   are rather limited  The State \' s original function of maintaining law and order within its borders gave rise to   police   administration which is a branch of the dispensation of   Justice   but on its preventive side  police jurisdiction has a special character of its own  which distinguishes it from ordinary judicial work  In the   curfew    the State shows early in history the importance of preventing disorder  In early days  next to maintaining law and order  the State was concerned with the raising of   revenue    It was then useful to the State to establish a   Technical standard standard   of   weights and measures   so that value could be generally accepted and finally the State acquired a   monopoly   of   coin  age  The regulation of labor by the State as one of its functions dates from the 15th century  when   the Black Plague   killed around half of the European population   Citation needed date January 2011   \n  \n The invariable policy of the State has always been to break down all intermediate authorities and to deal directly with the individual  This was the policy until   Adam Smith   \' s  \'  \'   The Wealth of Nations   \'  \'  was published promoting a strong public reaction against State interference  By its own action  the State raised the issue of the poor or the State relief of the   indigent    The State  of course  did not create poverty but by destroying the chief agencies which dealt with it such as the village  the church and the   guild  s  it practically assumed full responsibility for the poor without exercising any power over it  The Great Poor Law Report of 1834 showed that   communism   was widespread in the rural areas of England  In newly developed countries such as the   colonies   of the   British Empire    the State has refused to take responsibility for the poor and the relief of poverty  although the poor classes lean heavily towards State socialism   Citation needed date January 2011   \n  \n Taking into account the arguably significant powers of the State  it is only natural that in times of great crisis such as an overwhelming calamity the people should invoke general State aid   Citation needed date January 2011   \n  \n Political representation has helped to shape State administration  When the voice of the individual can be heard  the danger of arbitrary interference by the State is greatly reduced  To that extent is the increase of State activity popular  There are no hard and fast rules to limit State administration but it is a fallacy to believe that the State is the nation and what the State does is necessarily for the good of the nation  In the first place  even in modern times  the State and the nation are never identical  Even where  quot universal suffrage quot  prevails  the fact remains that an extension of State administration means an increased interference of some by others  limiting freedom of action  Even if it is admitted that State and nation are one and the same  it is sometimes difficult to admit that State administration is necessarily good  Finally  the modern indiscriminate advocacy of State administration conceals the fallacy that State officials must necessarily prove more effective in their action than   private enterprise    Herein lies the basic difference between   Public administration public   and   business administration    the first deals with the   public weal   while the second deals basically in   Profit  accounting  profit    but both require a great deal of   education   and   ethical code ethical conduct   to

constitution is a written document  there is also an unwritten constitution  The unwritten constitution is continually being written by the legislative branch of government  this is just one of those cases in which the nature of the circumstances determines the form of government that is most appropriate  England did set the fashion of written constitutions during the   English Civil War Civil War   but after the   Restoration  England  Restoration   abandoned them to be taken up later by the   American Colonies   after their   American Revolution emancipation   and then   France   after the

meaning of left wing and right wing varies considerably between different countries and at different times  but generally speaking  it can be said that the right wing often values   tradition   and

' \n   Newspaper industry   \n The newspaper industry within the liberal model is characterized by   newspaper   circulation and the early development of mass circulation commercial press  The first instances of newspapers appearing in the west is during the 17th century in Europe with the first instance of what we would call a newspaper appearing in Germany  This paper was called the  \'  \'

invent the   printing press    it had a very early development of the media format that came from it known a  quot press quot   With the expansion of technology  commercial media quickly expanded to encompass many forms  It evolved from standard newspapers and became a part of radio  music  television  movies  and the Internet  as well as many other forms of media  lt ref gt  quot Mass Media quot

actors and the media and more generally the extent to which media reflects   political divisions        sfn Hardy 2008 p 18   In their book   \'  \' Comparing Media Systems  Three Models of Media and Politics \'  \'   Daniel C  Hallin and Paola Mancini use this term to evaluate the link between   political parties   and media organizations   In the North Atlantic or liberal model  Hallin and Mancini  give a description of political parallelism in the United States  British  Irish  and Canadian media systems   According to Hallin and Mancini the United States contains the most unbiased political parallelism compared to the previous four countries   Hallin and Mancini express how press political partisan is virtually absent in the North Atlantic or liberal model  with the exception of Britain which poses strong press parallelism   Hallin and Mancini insist that in the North Atlantic or liberal model there is a balance within the contents of the media in order to create neutrality within the media system    However  Hetty van Kempen believes it is still likely that press party parallelism will still vary within the countries of the same model   Kempen reflects on the

as the basis for defining the user experience measures  for example  \n  \n  Utility  Does the user perceive the functions in the system as useful and fit for the purpose  \n  Usability  Does the user

\n   UXA Methods   \n  \n An individual method can collect data about a set of specific constructs of user experience  for instance   usability testing   is used to collect data about usability construct   Methods also differ if they are to measure a momentary  or episodic experience i e   assessing how a person feels about a specific interaction episode or after executing a task   or an experience over time  also known as an longitudinal experience  UXA methods can be classified in three categories   Implicit  Explicit and Creative methods   The measures and methods for these categories are described below  \n  \n    Implicit UXA Methods    \n  \n Implicit methods of UX research focus not just only on what the users say  but also on what the user cannot express verbally   Many available tools can assist in the implicit evaluation  in particular to gather implicit or objective data  When available  UX researchers utilize state of the art equipment to uncover all aspects of the experience  \n  \n Examples of implicit evaluation methods and tools  \n    Eye Tracking   \n  Attention Tracking \n  User Tracking \n  Task and reaction measurement Galvanic Skin Response or   skin conductance   \n    Electroencephalography   EEG such as   Emotiv   \n  Observation Studies    participant observation   where observers monitor the participant \' s reactions such as facial and other gestures  the tone of voice or other body language cues  \n  \n    Explicit UXA Methods    \n  \n Explicit methods of UX research explore what the user is consciously aware of getting them to reflect on their own feelings or thoughts  and gather their views and opinions   An important aspect of explicit methods includes   usability testing   and emotion evaluation  \n  \n Emotion Assessment \n When investigating momentary user experiences  we can evaluate the level of positive affect  negative affect  joy  surprise  frustration  etc  The measures for emotions are bound to the methods used for emotion assessment  but typical emotion measures are e g    Valence  psychology  valence   and   arousal    Objective emotion data can be collected by   psychophysiological   measurements or by observing   expressed emotion  s  Subjective emotional data can be collected by using  http   en wiktionary org wiki self report self report  methods  which can be verbal or non

One of the major things that have helped automobiles to provide more safety and convenience is electronics  With the advances in technology and electronics  car manufacturers have been able to offer a wide variety of services and conveniences  From the creation of the Electronic Fuel Injection to the popular Global Positioning System found standard in many cars today  the auto industry has revolutionized the way people travel from place to place    So many new and exciting technologies are available that play a role in cars  from cameras that read facial expressions to sensors that measure everything going on inside as well as outside of the vehicle  that understanding the impacts on safety as well as the overall UX are very important steps to take to make it successful   Understanding how people interact with vehicles today  what contributes to a great driving experience  what is their current relationship with the car  what placement does it have in their lives  is key to the development of these technologies   This information ensures user centered design practices to generate cohesive  predictive and desirable designs   Once specific design concepts and ideas are on the table  UXA researchers further explore how people react to them regarding desirability  findability  usefulness  credibility  accessibility  usability and   human factors   metrics   Outcomes of this work includes user requirements  concept validation  and design guidelines  lt ref name  quot Speech Guidelines quot    gt  Researchers have conducted intriguing research to answer

' \n The role of the technology management function in an organization is to understand the value of certain technology for the organization  Continuous development of technology is valuable as long as there is a value for the customer and therefore the technology management function in an organization should be able to argue when to invest on technology development and when to withdraw   \n  \n Technology management can also be defined as the integrated planning  design  optimization  operation and control of technological products  processes and services  a better definition would be the management of the use of technology for human advantage   \n  \n The  \'  \'   Association of Technology  Management  and Applied Engineering   \'  \'  defines technology management as the field concerned with the supervision of personnel across the technical spectrum and a wide variety of complex technological systems  Technology management programs typically include instruction in production and operations management  project management  computer applications  quality control  safety and health issues  statistics  and general management principles  lt ref gt ATMAE Venn Diagram  https   atmae site ym com  page AboutATMAE  lt  ref gt  \n  \n Perhaps the most authoritative input to our understanding of technology is the   diffusion of innovations   theory developed in the first half of the twentieth  century  It suggests that all innovations follow a similar diffusion pattern   best known today in the form of an  quot s quot  curve though originally based upon the concept of a standard distribution of adopters  In broad terms the  quot s quot  curve suggests four phases of a technology life cycle    \'  \' emerging \'  \'    \'  \' growth \'  \'    \'  \' mature \'  \'  and  \'  \' aging \'  \'   \n  \n These four phases are coupled to increasing levels of acceptance of an   innovation   or  in our case a new technology  In recent times for many technologies an inverse curve   which corresponds to a declining cost per unit   has been postulated  This may not prove to be universally true though for information technology where much of the cost is in the initial phase it has been a reasonable expectation  \n  \n The second major contribution to this area is the Carnegie Mellon   Capability Maturity Model    This model proposes that a series of progressive capabilities can be quantified through a set of threshold tests  These tests determine  \'  \' repeatability \'  \'    \'  \' definition \'  \'    \'  \' management \'  \'  and  \'  \' optimization \'  \'   The model suggests that any organization has to master one level before being able to proceed to the next  \n  \n The third significant contribution comes from Gartner   the research service  it is the   hype cycle    this suggests that our modern approach to marketing technology results in the technology being over hyped in the early stages of growth  Taken together  these fundamental concepts provide a foundation for formalizing the approach to managing technology  \n  \n    Accreditation and certification    \n  \n The   Association of Technology  Management  and Applied Engineering    ATMAE   accredits selected collegiate programs in technology management  An instructor or graduate of a technology management program may choose to become a Certified Technology Manager  CTM  by sitting for a rigorous exam administered by ATMAE covering production planning  amp  control  safety  quality  and management supervision    \n  \n ATMAE program accreditation is recognized by the   Council for Higher Education Accreditation    CHEA  for accrediting technology management programs  CHEA recognizes ATMAE in the U S  for accrediting associate  baccalaureate  and master   s degree programs in technology  applied technology  engineering technology  and technology related disciplines delivered by national or regional accredited institutions in \n the United States  2011  lt ref gt ATMAE Scope of Recognition  http   www chea org pdf d Summary 20for 20ATMAE pdf  lt  ref gt  \n  \n   See also   \n     Technology forecasting   \n     Innovation management   \n     Dominant design   \n  \n    References    \n   reflist   \n  \n    Further reading    \n    cite journal \n   author Kropsu Vehkapera  H   Haapasalo  H   amp  Rusanen  J P  \n   title Analysis of Technology Management Functions in Finnish High Tech Companies  \n   journal The Open Management Journal \n   year 2009 \n   volume 2 \n   issue   \n   pages 1 amp ndash 10 \n   url  http   www bentham open org pages content php TOMANAJ 2009 00000002 00000001 1TOMANAJ SGM \n   id  \n   doi  10 2174 1874948800902010001 \n   ISSN  1874 9488  \n    \n  \n   Technology   \n   Management   \n  \n   Category Information technology management   \n   Category Technology   \n ',3

an improvement at the time  email reinforces the limits of the student teacher model rather than expanding dialogue  With updated technologies  such as video conferencing  discussion boards  and Wikipedia storming  digital learning platforms expand the number of opportunities for writing intervention by providing structured dialogue and an expanded audience  The heavy lifting of working with an individual on writing challenges no longer rests exclusively on the teacher  Much analysis of OWLs conflates data from old asynchronous models to more current platforms  which misrepresents the effectiveness of this method  Further  according to Gee  digital age experts are rarely accurate in predicting outcomes  Education in a digital age needs to undergo a saber metrics revolution where

Myers    David Tudor    and a group of over 75 artists and engineers from the US and Japan  The original structure consisted of a   Buckminster Fuller   style   geodesic dome   covered by a water vapor cloud sculpture  designed by Fujiko Nakaya  The architect John Pearce devised a way that a   Mylar   mirror could be fitted inside the structure  \n  \n The   optical   effect in the   spherical   mirror produced real images resembling that of a   hologram    Due to the size of the mirror  a spectator looking at an image could walk around it and see it from all sides  On the terrace surrounding the Pepsi Pavilion were seven of Robert Breer   s  quot Floats quot   six foot high   kinetic sculpture  s that moved around at less than 2 feet per minute  while emitting sounds  When a

Fluxus   and the   Happenings   Actions of the 1960s  through the current generation of   digital art  ists for whom multimedia and technology are the norm  The lineage from E A T  experimentations in the 1960s which led to media art explorations of the 1990s and beyond  is the same historical pathway that has led to the ArtScience movement of the 2000s    the latter an amalgamation of E A T   the

be best exemplified by the voluminous corpus of   technical drawing  s which the artist engineers left behind  reflecting the wide variety of interests the Renaissance   Homo universalis   pursued  The establishment of the laws of linear perspective by   Filippo Brunelleschi Brunelleschi   gave his successors  such as   Taccola      Francesco di Giorgio Martini   and   Leonardo da Vinci    a powerful instrument to depict mechanical devices for the first time in a realistic manner  The extant sketch books give modern historians of science invaluable insights into the standards of technology of the time  Renaissance engineers showed a strong proclivity to experimental study  drawing a variety of technical devices  many of which appeared for the first time in history on paper  \n  \n However  these designs were not always intended to be put into practice  and often practical limitations impeded the application of the revolutionary designs  For example  da Vinci \' s ideas on the conical   parachute   or the winged flying machine were only applied much later  While earlier scholars showed a tendency to attribute inventions based on their first pictorial appearance to individual Renaissance engineers  modern scholarship is more prone to view the devices as products of a technical evolution which often went back to the Middle Ages  \n  \n    class  quot wikitable

have realized they could do better by concentrating on making arrowheads and barter for other needs  Clearly  regardless of goods and services bartered  some amount of technology was involved amp

modern world  superior technologies  resources  geography  and history give rise to robust economies  and in a well functioning  robust economy  economic excess naturally flows into greater use of technology  Moreover  because technology is such an inseparable part of human society  especially in its economic aspects  funding sources for  new  technological endeavors are virtually illimitable  However  while in the beginning  technological investment involved little more than the time  efforts  and skills of one or a few men  today  such investment may involve the collective labor and skills of many millions  \n  \n    Funding    \n Consequently  the sources of funding for large technological efforts have dramatically narrowed  since few have ready access to the collective labor of a whole society  or even a large part  It is conventional to divide up funding sources into governmental  involving whole  or nearly whole  social   Organization enterprises    and private  involving more limited  but generally more sharply focused  business or individual enterprises  \n  \n     Government funding for new technology     \n The government is a major contributor to the development of new technology in many ways  In the United States alone  many government agencies specifically invest billions of dollars in new technology  \n  \n  In 1980  the UK government invested just over 6 million pounds in a four year program  later extended to six years  called the   Microelectronics Education Programme    MEP   which was intended to give every school in Britain at least one computer  software  training materials  and extensive teacher training  Similar programs have been instituted by governments around the world   \n  \n Technology has frequently been driven by the military  with many modern applications developed for the military before they were adapted for civilian use  However  this has always been a two way flow  with industry often developing and adopting a technology only later adopted by the military  \n  \n Entire government agencies are specifically dedicated to research  such as America \' s   National Science Foundation    the United Kingdom \' s   List of UK

budget to research and development  \n  \n     Private funding     \n   Research and development   is one of the smallest areas of investments made by corporations toward new and innovative technology  \n  lt    source needed   gt  \n  \n Many foundations and other nonprofit organizations contribute to the development of technology  In the   OECD    about two thirds of   research and development   in scientific and technical fields is carried out by industry  and 98 percent and 10 percent respectively by   universities   and government  But in poorer countries such as   Portugal   and   Mexico   the industry contribution is significantly less  The U S  government spends more than other countries on military research and development  although the proportion has fallen from about 30 percent in the 1980s to less than 10 percent  lt ref gt  http   www oecd org dataoecd 49 45 24236156 pdf    dead link date July 2012   lt  ref gt  \n  \n The 2009 founding of   Kickstarter   allows individuals to receive funding via   crowdsourcing   for many technology related products including both new physical creations as well as documentaries  films  and webseries that focus on   technology management     This circumvents the corporate or government oversight most inventors and artists struggle against but leaves the accountability of the project completely with the individual receiving the funds

technology influences the   Values Personal and cultural values values   of a society by changing expectations and realities   The implementation of technology is also influenced by values  There are  at least  three major  interrelated values that inform  and are informed by  technological innovations  \n    Mechanism  philosophy  Mechanistic world view    Viewing the universe as a collection of parts   like a machine   that can be individually analyzed and understood  lt ref name   McGinn gt   harv McGinn 1991   lt  ref gt  This is a form of   reductionism   that is rare nowadays  However  the  quot neo mechanistic world view quot  holds that nothing in the universe cannot be understood by the human intellect  Also  while all things are greater than the sum of their parts  e g   even if we consider nothing more than the information involved in their combination   in principle  even this excess must eventually be understood by human intelligence  That is  no   Divinity divine   or   Vitalism vital   principle or essence is involved  \n  \n    Efficiency  economics  Efficiency    A value  originally applied only to machines  but now applied to all aspects of society  so that each element is expected to attain a higher and higher percentage of its maximal possible performance  output  or ability  \n    Social progress    The belief that there is such a thing as social progress  and that  in the main  it is beneficent  Before the   Industrial Revolution    and the subsequent explosion of technology  almost all societies believed in a   cyclical theory   of social movement and  indeed  of all history and the universe  This was  obviously  based on the cyclicity of the seasons  and an agricultural economy \' s and society \' s strong ties to that cyclicity  Since much of the world is closer to their agricultural roots  they are still much more amenable to cyclicity than progress in history  This may be seen  for example  in  http   www metafuture org sarkar prabhat htm Prabhat rainjan sarkar \' s modern social cycles theory   For a more westernized version of social cyclicity  see  \'  \' Generations  The History of America \' s Future  1584 to 2069 \'  \'

organizations  e g   governments  the military  health and social welfare institutions  supranational corporations  \n  The commercialization of leisure  sports events  products  etc   McGinn  \n  The almost instantaneous dispersal of information  especially news  and entertainment around the world  \n  \n    International    \n Technology enables greater knowledge of international issues  values  and cultures   Due mostly to mass transportation and mass media  the world seems to be a much smaller place  due to the following     citation needed date February 2013   \n  Globalization of ideas \n  Embeddedness of values \n  Population growth and control \n  \n   Environment   \n   Main Environmental technology   \n Technology provides an understanding  and an appreciation for the world around us  \n  \n Most modern technological processes produce unwanted by products in addition to the desired products  which is known as industrial waste and pollution   While most material waste is re used in the industrial process  many forms are released into the environment  with negative environmental side effects  such as pollution and lack of sustainability   Different social and political systems establish different balances between the value they place on additional goods versus the disvalues of waste products and pollution  Some technologies are designed specifically with the environment in mind  but most are designed first for economic or ergonomic effects  Historically  the value of a clean environment and more efficient productive processes has been the result of an increase in the wealth of society  because once people are able to provide for their basic needs  they are able to focus on less tangible goods such as clean air and water  \n  \n The effects of technology on the environment are both obvious and subtle   The more obvious effects include the depletion of nonrenewable natural resources  such as petroleum  coal  ores   and the added   pollution   of air  water  and land  The more subtle effects include debates over long term effects  e g   global warming  deforestation  natural habitat destruction  coastal wetland loss   \n  \n Each wave of technology creates a set of waste previously unknown by humans    toxic waste      radioactive waste      electronic waste    \n  \n One of the main problems is the lack of an effective way to remove these pollutants on a large scale expediently  In nature  organisms  quot recycle quot  the wastes of other organisms  for example  plants produce oxygen as a by product of photosynthesis  oxygen breathing organisms use oxygen to metabolize food  producing carbon dioxide as a by product  which plants use in a process to make sugar  with oxygen as a waste in the first place  No such mechanism exists for the removal of technological wastes  \n  \n   Construction and shaping   \n  \n    Choice    \n Society also controls technology through the choices it makes   These choices not only include consumer demands  they also include  \n  the channels of distribution  how do products go from raw materials to consumption to disposal  \n  the cultural beliefs regarding style  freedom of choice  consumerism  materialism  etc   \n  the economic values we place on the environment  individual wealth  government control  capitalism  etc  \n  \n According to Williams and Edge  lt ref gt   harv Williams Edge 1996   lt  ref gt  the construction and shaping of technology includes the concept of choice  and not necessarily conscious choice   Choice is inherent in both the design of individual artifacts and systems  and in the making of those artifacts and systems  \n  \n The idea here is that a single technology may not emerge from the unfolding of a predetermined logic or a single determinant  technology could be a garden of forking paths  with different paths potentially leading to different technological outcomes  This is a position that has been developed in detail by   Judy Wajcman   Therefore  choices could have differing implications for society and for particular social groups hh \n  \n    Autonomous technology    \n In one line of thought  technology develops autonomously  in other words  technology seems to feed on itself  moving forward with a force irresistible by humans  To these individuals  technology is  quot inherently dynamic and self augmenting  quot  lt ref gt   harv McGinn 1991 p 73   lt  ref gt  \n  \n   Jacques Ellul   is one proponent of the irresistibleness of technology to humans   He espouses the idea that humanity cannot resist the temptation of expanding our knowledge and our technological abilities   However  he does not believe that this seeming autonomy of technology is inherent   But the perceived autonomy is because humans do not adequately consider the responsibility that is inherent in technological processes  \n  \n   Langdon Winner   critiques the idea that   Radovan Richta technological evolution   is essentially beyond the control of individuals or society in his book Autonomous Technology  He argues instead that the apparent autonomy of technology is a result of  quot technological somnambulism  quot  the tendency of people to uncritically and unreflectively embrace and utilize new technologies without regard for their broader social and political effects   \n  \n    Government    \n Individuals rely on governmental assistance to control the side effects and negative consequences of technology  \n  Supposed independence of government  An assumption commonly made about the government is that their governance role is neutral or independent  However some argue that governing is a political process  so government will be influenced by political winds of influence  In addition  because government provides much of the funding for technological research and development  it has a vested interest in certain outcomes  Other point out that the world \' s biggest ecological disasters  such as the   Aral Sea      Chernobyl    and   Lake Karachay   have been caused by government projects  which are not accountable to consumers  \n  \n  Liability   One means for controlling technology is to place responsibility for the harm with the agent causing the harm   Government can allow more or less legal liability to fall to the organizations or individuals responsible for damages  \n  Legislation   A source of controversy is the role of industry versus that of government in maintaining a clean environment   While it is generally agreed that industry needs to be held responsible when pollution harms other people  there is disagreement over whether this should be prevented by legislation or civil courts  and whether ecological systems as such should be protected from harm by governments  \n  \n Recently  the social shaping of technology has had new influence in the fields of   e science   and   e social science   in the United Kingdom  which has made centers focusing on the social shaping of   science and technology   a central part of their funding programs  \n  \n   See also   \n   Portal Technology   \n   columns list colwidth 30em  \n     Appropriate technology   \n     History of

experimental critical function and or characteristic proof of concept    At this step in the maturation process  active research and development  R amp D  is initiated  This must include both analytical studies to set the technology into an appropriate context and laboratory based studies to physically validate that the analytical predictions are correct  These studies and experiments should constitute  quot proof of concept quot  validation of the applications concepts formulated at TRL 2  \n    \n   4  Component and or breadboard validation in laboratory environment    Following successful  quot proof of concept quot  work  basic technological elements must be integrated to establish that the  quot pieces quot  will work together to achieve concept enabling levels of

' \n    General description    \n  \n TA is the study and   evaluation   of new   technology technologies    It is based on the conviction that new developments within  and discoveries by  the   scientific community   are relevant for the world at large rather than just for the scientific experts themselves  and that technological progress can never be free of   ethics ethical   implications  Also  technology assessment recognizes the fact that   scientist  s normally are not trained   ethicist  s themselves and accordingly ought to be very careful when passing ethical judgement on their own  or their colleagues  new findings  projects  or   work in progress    \n  \n Technology assessment assumes a global perspective and is   future   oriented  not anti technological  TA considers its task as interdisciplinary approach to solving already existing problems and preventing potential damage caused by the uncritical application and the   commercialisation commercialization   of new technologies   \n  \n Therefore any results of technology assessment studies must be published  and particular consideration must be given to communication with   politician political decision makers    \n  \n An important problem concerning technology assessment is the so called   Collingridge dilemma    on the one hand  impacts of new technologies cannot be easily predicted until the technology is extensively developed and widely used  on the other hand  control or change of a technology is difficult as soon as it is widely used  \n  \n Technology assessments  which are a form of   Cost benefit analysis    are difficult if not impossible to carry out in an objective manner since subjective decisions and value judgments have to be made regarding a number of complex issues such as  a  the boundaries of the analysis  i e   what costs are internalized and externalized    b  the selection of appropriate indicators of potential positive and negative consequences of the new technology   c  the monetization of non market values  and  d  a wide range of ethical perspectives  lt ref gt  Huesemann  Michael H   and Joyce A  Huesemann  2011    http   www newtechnologyandsociety org  \'  \'

biased by the values of the most powerful stakeholders  which are in many cases the developers and proponents  i e   corporations and governments  of new technologies under consideration  In the most extreme view  as expressed by Ian Barbour in        Technology  Environment  and Human Values        technology assessment is    a one sided apology for contemporary technology by people with a stake

' \n Well neutralised   banknotes   cannot be brought back into circulation easily  They can be linked to the crime scene and restricted procedures are in place to exchange them at the   financial institution    This makes stealing neutralised banknotes uneconomical and impractical  The IBNS removes the anticipated reward of the crime and increases the risk of being caught  This not only foils the theft but acts as a deterrent against further attacks  \n  \n Today the most common cash degradation agent is ink but other agents are also available  \n  \n   File Autocollant de SANBB jpg thumb

create a secure system to provide additional security for   Cash in transit    The very first IBNS prototype using coloured smoke as neutralisation agent was invented in UK   Saltash   by the UK company Spinnaker in 1982  This made use of very lightweight and simple to use containers  \n In 1990 the first industrialized End to End IBNS using security ink as a neutralization agent and accepted to be used in soft skinned vehicles was introduced to the Belgium market by French company Axytrans  lt ref name  quot france quot  gt  http   www fbf fr web Internet2010 Content nsf DocumentsByIDWeb

using coloured smoke were being used in soft skinned vehicles to great effect  showing that they were a viable alternative to cash transport using armoured trucks  \n  \n In 1991 France changed its regulations to allow the use of IBNS in soft skinned vehicles  The French CIT company VALTIS was the first to implement such a system to service three regional banks    \n  \n In 2002    Banque de France   implemented an international procedure to treat and exchange neutralized banknotes for CIT professionals   \n  \n In 2003  the   European Central Bank   made a decision that defined the

protect people  valuables and equipment and avoid using weapons and armoured vehicles  \n  \n    Legislation and regulations    \n The use of IBNS is usually regulated by the presence or absence of a

' \n  \'  \'  \'   Communication   \'  \'  \'  is a phenomenon that we all think we can recognise  There is  however  no universal agreement on a definition  lt ref gt Fiske  John   1990  Introduction to Communication Studies  second edition   London  Routledge  lt  ref gt  The definition of communication varies across academic disciplines and between different theories  schools  and approaches  \n  \n Communication Theory has one universal law  written by S  F  Scudder in the early 1900s  and later published in 1980   citation needed date July 2014   The Universal Communication Law  Universal law of Communication  states that     All living entities  beings and creatures communicate      citation needed date July 2014   In an interview  Scudder clarified the concept        All of the living communicate through movements  sounds  reactions  physical changes  gestures  languages  breath  colour transformations  etc  Communication is a means of survival  existence and being and does not need another to acknowledge its presence  Examples     the cry of a child   the release of Ethylene that makes apples ripen at the same time  communication that enables an apple tree \' s apples

living systems is the exchange of information with its environment and with other living systems   In his book  Flor  2004  page 4  extends this argument by forwarding that     All living systems  from the simplest to the most complex  are equipped to perform these critical functions  They are called critical because they are necessary for the survival of the living system  Communication is nothing more than the exchange of information  Hence  at its broadest sense  environmental communication is necessary for the survival of every living system  be it an organism  an ecosystem  or  even  a social system     lt ref gt   cite journal title Communication Definitions  journal Environmental Communication  date June 2013  url http    20http   topdefinitions com 2013 06 20 environmental

' \n   Origins   \n Work on technological transitions draws on a number of fields including   history of science    technology studies  and   evolutionary economics    lt ref name  quot Geels quot    gt  The focus of evolutionary economics is on economic change  but as a driver of this   technological change   has been considered in the literature  lt ref name  quot Geels a quot  gt Geels  F W   2005  Technological transitions and system innovations  Cheltenham  Edward Elgar Publishing  lt  ref gt  Joseph   Schumpeter    in his classic  \'  \' Theory of Economic Development \'  \'  lt ref gt Schumpeter  T   1934  The theory of economic development  an inquiry into profits  capital  credit  interest  and the business cycle  Cambridge  Mass  Harvard University Press lt  ref gt  placed the emphasis on non economic forces as the driver for growth  The human actor  the entrepreneur is seen as the cause of economic development which occurs as a cyclical process     Schumpeter   proposed that radical innovations were the catalyst for Kondratiev cycles  \n  \n    Long wave theory    \n The Russian economist Kondratiev lt ref gt Kondratiev  N   1925  Major Economic Cycles  Moscow  lt  ref gt  proposed that economic growth operated in boom and bust cycles of approximately 50 year periods  These cycles were characterised by periods of expansion  stagnation and recession  The period of expansion is associated with the introduction of a new technology  e g  steam power or the microprocessor  At the time of publication    Kondratiev   had considered that two cycles had occurred in the nineteenth century and third was beginning at the turn of the twentieth  Modern writers  such as Freeman and Perez lt ref name  quot Freeman quot  gt Freeman  C  and Perez  C   1988  Structural crisis of adjustment  business cycles and investment behaviour in Dosi et al Technical Change and Economic Theory  London  Frances Pinter  pp  38 66  lt  ref gt  outlined five cycles in the modern age

Society  1930   1980  \n   The Information Age  1980    \n  \n Freeman and Perez lt ref name  quot Freeman quot    gt  proposed that each cycle consists of pervasive technologies  their production and economic structures that support them  Termed    techno economic paradigms     they suggest that the shift from one paradigm to another is the result of emergent new technologies   \n  \n Following the   Financial crisis of 2007   2008 recent economic crisis    authors such as Moody and Nogrady lt ref gt Moody  J B   and Nogrady  B   2011  The Sixth Wave  How to Succeed in a Resource Limited

paradigms  trajectories and regimes    \n   Thomas Kuhn   lt ref gt Kuhn  T   1962  The structure of scientific revolutions  Chicago  London   University of Chicago Press lt  ref gt  described how a paradigm shift is a wholesale shift in the basic understanding of a scientific theory  Examples in science include the change of thought from miasma to germ theory as a cause of disease   Building on this work    Giovanni Dosi   lt ref gt Dosi  G   1982  Technological paradigms and technological trajectories  Research Policy 11  3  pp  147 162  lt  ref gt  developed the concept of    technical paradigms    and    technological trajectories      In considering how engineers work  the technical paradigm is an outlook on the technological problem  a definition of what the problems and solutions are  It charts the idea of specific progress  By identifying the problems to be solved the paradigm exerts an influence on technological change  The pattern of problem solving activity and the direction of progress is the technological trajectory   In similar fashion  Nelson and Winter    lt ref gt Nelson  R R   Winter  S G   1977  In search of useful theory of innovation  Research

technological regime    which directs technological change through the beliefs of engineers of what problems to solve  The work of the actors and organisations is the result of organisational and cognitive routines which determines search behaviour  This places boundaries and also trajectories  direction  to those boundaries  \n  \n   Multi level perspective on technological transitions   \n In analysing  historic  cases of technological transitions researchers from the systems in transition branch of transitions research have used a multi level perspective  MLP  as a heuristic model to understand changes in socio technical systems    lt ref name  quot Geels quot    gt  lt ref name  quot Rip quot  gt Rip  A  and R  Kemp   1998  Technological change  In S  Rayner and E  Malone \n  eds

only one aspect   \n  \n The MLP proposes three analytical levels  the niche  regime and landscape   \n  \n  \'  \'  \' Niche \'  \'  \'   Micro level  \n Radical innovations occur at the niche level  These act as    safe havens    for fledgling technologies to develop  largely free from market pressures which occur at the regime level  lt ref name  quot Geels quot    gt  lt ref name  quot Kemp quot    gt  The US Military has acted as niche for major twentieth century technologies such as the aircraft  radio and the internet  More recently  California   s Silicon Valley has provided an arena for   Information and communications technology ICT   focused technologies to emerge  Some innovations will challenge the existing regime while others fail   \n  \n  \'  \'  \' Regime \'  \'  \'   Meso level  \n The socio technical regime  as defined by Geels  lt ref name  quot Geels quot    gt  includes a web of inter linking actors across different social groups and communities following a set of rules   In effect  the established practices of a given system  Seven dimensions have been identified in the socio technical regime  technology  user practices and application  the symbolic meaning of technology  infrastructure  policy and techno scientific knowledge  lt ref name  quot Geels quot    gt  Change does occur at the regime level but it is normally slow and incremental unlike the radical change at the niche level  The actors who constitute the existing regime are set to gain from perpetuating the incumbent technology at the expense of the new  This is known as    lock in     lt ref name  quot Evans quot    gt  \n  \n  \'  \'  \' Landscape \'  \'  \'   Macro level  \n Exogenous to the previous levels is the socio technical landscape  lt ref name  quot Geels quot    gt  A broad range of factors are contained here  such as economic pressures  cultural values  social trends  wars and environmental issues  Change occurs at an even slower rate than at the regime level   \n  \n A transition is said to happen when a regime shift has occurred  This is the result of the interplay between the three levels   Regimes are relatively inert and resistant to change being structured to incremental innovation following established trajectories  lt ref gt Geels  F W   2010  Ontologies  socio technical transitions  to sustainability   and the multi level perspective  Research Policy 39 pp  495 510 lt  ref gt  As such  transitions are difficult to achieve  The current regime is typically suffering internal issues  Pressure from the landscape level may cause    cracks    or    windows of opportunity    through which innovations at the niche level may initially co exist with the established technology before achieving ascendency  Once the technology has fully embedded into society the transition is said to be completed  lt ref name  quot Genus quot  gt Genus   A   and Coles  A M   2008  Rethinking the multi level perspective of technological transitions  Research Policy  37  9  pp  1436 1445 lt  ref gt  \n  \n    Case study    \n The MLP has been used in describing a range of historic transitions in socio technical regimes for mobility  sanitation

technologies in key sectors such as transport  energy and housing  lt ref name  quot Smith quot    gt  \n  \n Geels  lt ref name  quot Geels quot    gt  lt ref name  quot Geels a quot    gt  presented three historical transitions on system innovation relating to modes of transportation  The technological transition from sailing ships to steamships in the UK will be summarised and shown in the context of a wider system innovation   \n  \n Great Britain was the world   s leading naval power in the nineteenth century  and led the way in the transition from sail to steam   At first  the introduction of steam technology co existed with the current regime  Steam tugs assisted sail ships into port and hybrid steam   sail ships appeared  Landscape developments create the necessity for improvements in the technology  A demand for trans Atlantic emigration was prompted by the Irish potato famine  European political instability and the lure of gold in California  The requirement for such arduous journeys had prompted a wealth of innovations at the niche level in steamship development  From the late 1880s  as steamship technology improved and costs dropped  the new technology was widely diffused and a new regime established  The changes go beyond a technological transition as it involved new ship management and fleet management practices  new supporting infrastructures and new functionalities  \n  \n   Transition paths   \n The nature of transitions varies and the differing qualities result in multiple pathways occurring  Geels and Scot  lt ref gt Geels  F W  and Schot  J W   2007   \' Typology of sociotechnical transition pathways   Research Policy  36  3   pp 399 417 lt  ref gt  defined five transition paths  \n  \n   Reproduction  Ongoing change occurring in the regime level  \n   Transformation   A socio technical regime that changes without the emergence of a monopolising technology  \n   Technological substitution  An incumbent technology is replaced by a radical innovation resulting in a new socio technical regime   E g  the automobile replacing the horse as the primary means of land transport   \n   De alignment and Re alignment  Weaknesses in the regime sees the advent of competing new technologies leading to a dominant model  \n   Re configuration  When multiple  interlinked technologies are replaced by a similarly linked alternative set  \n  \n   Characteristics of technological transitions   \n Six characteristics of technological transitions have been identified   lt ref name  quot Evans quot    gt  lt ref gt Geels  F   Monaghan  A   Eames  M  and Steward  F    2008  The feasibility of systems thinking in sustainable consumption and production policy  a report to the Department for Environment  Food and Rural Affairs  London  DEFRA  lt  ref gt  \n  \n  \'  \' Transitions are co evolutionary and multi dimensional \'  \'  \n Technological developments occur intertwined with societal needs  wants and uses  A technology is adopted and diffused based on this interplay between innovation and societal requirements  Co evolution has different aspects  As well as the co evolution of technology and society  aspects between science  technology  users and culture have been considered  lt ref name  quot Geels a quot    gt  \n   \n  \'  \' Multi actors are involved \'  \'  \n Scientific and engineering communities are central to the development of a technology  but a wide range of actors are involved in a transition  This can include organisations  policy makers  government  NGOs  special interest groups and others  \n  \n  \'  \' Transitions occur at multiple levels \'  \'  \n As shown in the MLP transitions occur through the interplay of processes at different levels   \n  \n  \'  \' Transitions are a long term process \'  \'  \n Complete system change takes time and can be decades in the making  Case studies show them to be between 40 and 90 years  lt ref name  quot Genus quot    gt  \n  \n  \'  \' Transitions are radical \'  \'  \n For a true transition to occur the technology has to be a radical innovation    \n  \n  \'  \' Change is Non linear \'  \'  \n The rate of change will vary over time  For example  the pace of change may be slow at the gestation period  at the niche level  but much more rapid when a breakthrough is occurring  \n  \n   Diffusion  transition phases   \n Diffusion of an innovation is the concept of how it is picked up by society  at what rate and why  Everett  1962  The diffusion of a technological innovation into society can be considered in distinct phases  lt ref name  quot Rotmans quot  gt Rotmans  J   Kemp  R  and van Asselt  M  2001  More evolution than revolution  transition management in public policy  Foresight  3  1  pp  15 31  lt  ref gt  Pre development is the gestation period where the new technology has yet to make an impact  Take off is when the process of a system shift is beginning  A breakthrough is occurring when fundamental changes are occurring in existing structures through the interplay of economic  social and cultural forces  Once the rate of change has decreased and a new balance is achieved  stabilization is said to have occurred  A full transition involves an overhaul of existing rules and change of beliefs which takes time  typically spanning at least a generation  lt ref name  quot Rotmans quot    gt  This process can be speeded up through seismic  unforeseen events such as war or economic strife   \n  \n Geels lt ref name  quot Geels a quot    gt  proposed a similar four phased approach which draws on the multi level perspective  MLP  developed by Dutch scholars  Phases one sees the emergence of a novelty  born from the existing regime  Development then occurs in the niche level at phase two   As before  breakthrough then occurs at phase three  In the parlance of the MLP the new technology  having been developed at the niche level  is in competition with the established regime  To breakthrough and achieve wide diffusion  external factors        windows of opportunity    are required  \n  \n   Windows of opportunity   \n A number of possible circumstances can act as windows of opportunity for the diffusion of new technologies   \n  \n   Internal technical problems in the existing regime  Those that cannot be solved by refinement of existing technologies act as a driver for the new  \n   Problems external to the system  Such    problems    are often determined by pressure groups and require wider societal or political backing  An example is environmental concerns  \n   Changing user preferences  Opportunities are presented if existing technologies cannot meet user needs  \n   Strategic advantage  Competition with rivals may necessitate innovation \n   Complimentary technology  The availability of which may enable a breakthrough \n  \n Alongside external influences  internal drivers catalyse diffusion  lt ref name  quot Geels a quot    gt  These include economic factors such as the price performance ration  Socio technical perspectives focus on the links between disparate social and technological elements  lt ref name  quot Rip quot    gt  Following the breakthrough  the final phases see the new technology supersede the old  \n  \n   Societal relevance   \n The study of technological transitions has an impact beyond academic interest  The transitions referred to in the literature may relate to historic processes  such as the transportation transitions studied by Geels  but system changes are required to achieve a safe transition to a low carbon economy    lt ref name  quot Evans quot    gt  lt ref name  quot Geels a quot    gt    Current structural problems are apparent in a range of sectors  lt ref name  quot Geels a quot    gt   Dependency on oil is problematic in the energy sector due to availability  access and contribution to greenhouse gas  GHG  emissions  Transportation is a major user of energy causing significant emission of GHGs   Food production will need to keep pace with an ever growing world population while overcoming challenges presented by global warming and transportation issues  Incremental change has provided some improvements but a more radical transition is required to achieve a more sustainable future   \n  \n Developed from the work on technological transitions is the field of transition management  Within this is an attempt to shape the direction of change complex socio technical systems to more sustainable patterns  lt ref name  quot Evans quot    gt  Whereas work on technological transitions is largely based on historic processes  proponents of transition management seek to actively steer transitions in progress  \n  \n   Criticisms   \n Genus and Coles lt ref name  quot Genus quot    gt  outlined a number of criticisms against the analysis of technological transitions  in particular when using the MLP  Empirical research on technological transitions occurring now has been limited  with the focus on historic transitions  Depending on the perspective on transition case studies they could be presented as having occurred on a different transition path to what was shown  For example  the bicycle could be considered an intermediate transport technology between the horse and the car  Judged from shorter different time frame this could appear a transition in its own right  Determining the nature of a transition is problematic  when it started and ended  or whether one occurred in the sense of a radical innovation displacing an existing socio technical regime  The perception of time casts doubt on whether a transition has occurred  If viewed over a long enough period even inert regimes may demonstrate radical change in the end  \n  \n    See also    \n

' \n Enamel has been used for art and decoration since the period of   Ancient Egypt    and for industry since the   Industrial Revolution     sfn Maskall White 1986 p 1   It is most commonly used in the production of   cookware    home appliances  bathroom fixtures  water heaters  and scientific laboratory equipment   sfn Maskall White 1986 pp 4 7   \n  \n   Characteristics   \n The most important characteristic of porcelain enamel  from an industrial perspective  is its resistance to   corrosion     sfn Maskall White 1986 p 8     Mild steel   is used in almost every industry and a huge array of products  porcelain enamel is a very economic way of protecting this  and other chemically vulnerable materials  from corrosion  It can also produce very smooth  glossy finishes in a wide array of colours  these colours will not fade on exposure to UV light  as paint will  Being a fired ceramic  porcelain enamel is also highly heat resistant  this allows it to be used in high temperature applications where an organic anti corrosion coating or   galvanization   may be impractical or even dangerous   \'  \' see   Metal fume fever   \'  \'     sfn Maskall White 1986 p 8   \n  \n Porcelain enamel also sees less frequent employment of some of its other properties  examples are its   Abrasive abrasion   resistance  where it may perform better than many metals  its resistance to   organic solvents    where it is entirely impervious  its resistance to   thermal shock    where it can resist rapid cooling from temperatures   nowrap 500  C   and higher  and its longevity   sfn

biokorrosive Prozesse jpg thumb The porcelain enamelled interior of a chemical reaction vessel   \n Porcelain enamel is used most often in the manufacture of products that will be expected to come under regular chemical attack or high heat such as cookware  burners  and   laboratory   equipment  It is used in the production of many household goods and appliances  especially those used in the   kitchen   or   bathroom   area  pots  pans  cooktops  appliances  sinks  toilets  bathtubs  even walls  counters  and other surfaces   sfn Maskall White 1986 pp 4 6   \n  \n Porcelain enamel is also used architecturally as a coating for wall panels  It may be used externally to provide   weather resistance   and desirable appearance  or internally to provide wear resistance  for example  on   escalator   side panels and tunnel walls  In recent years  agricultural silos have also been constructed with porcelain enamelled steel plates to protect the interior from corrosion and the exterior from weathering  this may indicate a future trend of coating all outdoor mild steel products in a weather resistant porcelain enamel   sfn Maskall White 1986 pp 4 6   \n  \n   Enamelling process   \n The application of industrial porcelain enamel can be a complicated process involving many different and very technical steps  All enamelling processes involve the mixture and preparation of  \'  \'  \' frit \'  \'  \'   the unfired enamel mixture  the preparation of the substrate  the application and firing  and then finishing processes  Most modern applications also involve two layers of enamel  a ground coat to bond to the substrate and a cover coat to provide the desired external properties  \n  \n Because frits frequently must be mixed and smelted at higher temperatures than the firing requires  most modern industrial enamellers do not mix their own frits completely  frit is most often purchased from dedicated frit producers in standard compositions and then any special ingredients added before application and firing   sfn Maskall White 1986 p 18   \n  \n    Frit    \n For ground coats  the composition of a frit for any given application is determined primarily by the metal used as the substrate  different varieties of steel  and different metals such as   aluminium   and   copper    require different frit compositions to bond to them  For cover coats the frit is composed to both bind to the ground coat and produce the desired external properties   sfn Maskall White 1986 p 20   Frit is normally prepared by mixing the ingredients and then milling the mixture into a powder  The ingredients  most often metal oxides and minerals such as    quartz    or   silica sand       soda ash      borax    and   Cobalt II  oxide cobalt oxide    are acquired in particulate form  the precise chemical composition and amount of each ingredient must be carefully measured and regulated   sfn Maskall White 1986 p   33   Once prepared  this powdered frit is then smelted and stirred to promote even distribution of materials  most frits are smelted at temperatures between 1150 and   nowrap 1300  C    After smelting  the frit is again milled into a powder  most often by   ball mill   grinding   sfn Maskall White 1986 p   37   \n  \n For wet application of enamel  a  \'  \'  \' slurry \'  \'  \'  of frit suspended in water must be created  In order to remain in suspension  frits must either be milled to an extremely fine particle size or mixed with a suspension agent such as   clay   or   electrolytes     sfn Maskall White 1986 p 41   \n  \n    Substrate    \n The metal to be used as a substrate is primarily determined by the application to which the product will be put  independent of any enamel considerations  Most commonly used are steels of various compositions  but also used are   aluminium   and   copper     sfn Maskall White 1986 p 50   \n  \n Before the application of enamel  the surface of the substrate must be prepared with a number of processes  The most important processes are the cleaning of the surface of the substrate  all remnants of chemicals    rusts    oils  and other contaminants must be completely removed  To facilitate this  frequent processes performed on substrates are   degreasing      Pickling  metal  pickling    which can also   Industrial etching etch   the surface and provide anchoring points for the enamel   alkaline   Neutralization  chemistry  neutralization    and rinsing   sfn Maskall White 1986 pp 62 75   \n  \n    Application    \n Enamel may be applied to the substrate via many different methods  These methods are most often delineated into either  \'  \'  \' wet \'  \'  \'  or  \'  \'  \' dry \'  \'  \'  applications  determined by whether the enamel is applied as a dry powder or a liquid slurry suspension  \n  \n     Dry application     \n The simplest method of dry application  especially for cast iron substrates  is to heat the substrate and roll it in powdered frit  The frit particles melt on contact with the hot substrate and adhere to its surface  This method requires a high level of operator skill and concentration to achieve an even coating  and due to its inconstant nature is not often used in industrial applications   sfn Maskall White 1986 p 79   \n  \n The most common method of dry application used in industry today is   electrostatic deposition    Before application  the dry frit must be encapsulated in an organic   Silanes silane    this allows the frit to hold an electrical charge during application  An electrostatic gun fires the dry frit powder onto the electrically earthed metal substrate  electrical forces bind the charged powder to the substrate and it adheres   sfn Maskall White 1986 p 83   \n  \n     Wet application     \n The simplest method of wet application is to dip the substrate in a bath of liquid slurry  complete immersion coats all available surfaces of the substrate  Dipping is not often used in industry  however  because many preliminary trial dippings are required before the thickness of the coat can be predicted reliably enough for the desired application   sfn Maskall White 1986 p 80   \n  \n A form of dipping suitable for modern industrial application is flow coating  Rather than dip the product in a bath of slurry  slurry is flowed over the surface of the product to be coated  This method allows for much more economical use of slurry and time  it is capable of allowing very rapid production runs   sfn Maskall White 1986 p 81   \n  \n Wet enamel may also be sprayed onto the product using specialized spray guns  Liquid slurry is fed into the nozzle of a spray gun  and compressed air atomizes the slurry and ejects it from the nozzle of the gun in a controlled jet   sfn Maskall White 1986 p 81   \n  \n    Firing    \n Firing  where coated substrates are passed through a furnace to experience long periods of stable high temperatures  converts the adhering particles of frit into a continuous glass layer  The effectiveness of the process is highly dependent on the time  temperature  and the quality or thickness of the coating on the substrate  Most frits for industrial applications are fired for as low as 20 minutes  but frits for very heavy duty industrial applications may take double this time  Porcelain enamel coatings on aluminium substrates may be fired at temperatures as low as 530  C  but most steel substrates require temperatures in excess of 800  C   sfn Maskall White 1986 p 86   \n  \n   History   \n   Vitreous enamel History Porcelain enamel   has been applied to jewelry metals such as   gold      silver    and   copper   since antiquity for the purposes of decoration  It was not until the   Industrial Revolution   that   Ferrous metallurgy ferrous metals   first became the subject of porcelain enamelling processes  these first attempts were met with limited success  A reliably successful technique was not developed until the middle of the 19th century  with the development of a method for enamelling   cast iron   cooking pots in   Germany     sfn Maskall White 1986 p 1   It was not long before this method of enamelling became outdated with the development of new ferrous substrates  and most modern research into porcelain enamelling is concerned with creating an acceptable bond between enamels and new metal substrates   sfn Maskall White 1986 pp 1 2   \n  \n The production of porcelain enamelled products on an industrial scale first began in Germany in 1840   sfn Maskall White 1986 p 2   The method used was very primitive compared to modern methods  the product was heated to a very high temperature and dusted with enamel  then immediately fired  This frequently resulted in poor adhesion or a spotty coat  two coats were always required to achieve a continuous  corrosion resistant surface   sfn Maskall White 1986 p 2   It could only be applied to   Cast iron cast    and   wrought iron    and only used for relatively simple products like pots and pans  \n  \n The ability to apply porcelain enamel to sheet steels was not developed until 1900   sfn Maskall White 1986 p 3   with the discovery that making minor changes to the composition of the enamel  such as including   cobalt   oxides as minor components  could drastically improve its adhesion ability to carbon steels  Concurrent with this development was the first use of wet slurry enamel application  this allowed porcelain enamel to be applied to much more complex shapes by dipping the shape into the liquid enamel slurry  \n  \n Up until the 1930s  all enamel applications required two coats of enamel  an undercoat to adhere to the substrate which was always blue  due in part to the presence of cobalt oxides   and a top coat of the desired colour  most often white   It was not until 1930 that the use of  \'  \'  \' zero carbon \'  \'  \'  steel  steel with less than 0 005  carbon content  as a substrate was linked to allowing lighter colored enamels to adhere directly to the substrate   sfn Maskall White 1986 p 4   \n  \n   Notes   \n   reflist   \n  \n   References   \n    cite book \n    last1  Maskall \n    first1  K A  \n    last2  White \n    first2

'  Information science   \n  \n  \'  \'  \' Science  technology and society \'  \'  \'    \'  \'  \' STS \'  \'  \'    also referred to as  \'  \'  \' science and technology studies \'  \'  \'   is the study of how social  political  and cultural   Value  personal and cultural  value  s affect   scientific research   and technological   innovation    and how these  in turn  affect   society      politics   and   culture    STS scholars are interested in a variety of problems including the relationships between scientific and technological innovations and society  and the directions and risks of science and technology  More than two dozen universities worldwide offer   bachelor \' s   degrees in STS  About half of these also offer doctoral or master \' s degrees  An STS model has been developed by scholars to consider the internal and external effects  The field of STS is related to   history and philosophy of science   although with a much broader emphasis on social aspects of science and technology  \n  \n   Content   \n Science  technology and society studies can include the following areas of concentration     biotechnology      environmental sustainability      information technology    lt ref gt https   sts stanford edu major sts thematic concentrations lt  ref gt  \n  \n As an interdisciplinary study  science  technology  and society brings together research findings from   anthropology      communications      sociology      politology      computer science      engineering    \n  \n   History   \n  \n STS is a new and expanding subject  Like most   interdisciplinary   programs  it emerged from the confluence of a variety of disciplines and disciplinary subfields  all of which had developed an interest   typically  during the 1960s or 1970s   in viewing science and technology as socially embedded enterprises   citation needed date January 2014   In 2011  111 STS programs were counted  lt ref gt  http   stswiki org index php title Worldwide directory of STS programs The STS Wiki   lt  ref gt  \n  \n    Early developments    \n The key disciplinary components of STS took shape independently  beginning in the 1960s  and developed in isolation from each other well into the 1980s  although   Ludwik Fleck   \' s monograph  1935   \'  \' Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact \'  \'  anticipated many of STS \' s key themes  \n  \n    Science studies    a branch of the   sociology of scientific knowledge   that places scientific controversies in their social context  \n    History of technology    that examines technology in its social and historical context  Starting in the 1960s  some historians questioned   technological determinism    a doctrine that can induce public passivity to technologic and scientific  \' natural \'  development   At the same time  some historians began to develop similarly contextual approaches to the   history of medicine    \n     History and philosophy of science    1960s   After the publication of    Thomas Kuhn   \' s well known  \'  \'   The Structure of Scientific Revolutions   \'  \'   1962   which attributed changes in scientific theories to changes in underlying intellectual   paradigm  s  programs were founded at the University of California  Berkeley and elsewhere that brought historians of science and philosophers together in unified programs  \n    Technology and society Science  technology  and society    In the mid  to late 1960s  student and faculty social movements in the U S   UK  and European universities helped to launch a range of new interdisciplinary fields  such as   women \' s studies    that were seen to address relevant topics that the traditional curriculum ignored  One such development was the rise of  quot science  technology  and society quot  programs  which are also   confusingly   known by the STS acronym  Drawn from a variety of disciplines  including anthropology  history  political science  and sociology  scholars in these programs created undergraduate curricula devoted to exploring the issues raised by science and technology  Unlike scholars in science studies  history of technology  or the history and philosophy of science  they were and are more likely to see themselves as activists working for change rather than dispassionate   quot ivory tower quot  researchers  Citation needed date February 2007    As an example of the activist impulse  feminist scholars in this and other emerging STS areas addressed themselves to the exclusion of women from science and engineering  \n  Science  engineering  and public policy studies emerged in the 1970s from the same concerns that motivated the founders of the science  technology  and society movement   A sense that science and technology were developing in ways that were increasingly at odds with the public \' s best interests   According to whom date November 2013   The science  technology  and society movement tried to humanize those who would make tomorrow \' s science and technology  but this discipline took a different approach  It would train students with the professional skills needed to become players in science and technology policy  Some programs came to emphasize quantitative methodologies  and most of these were eventually absorbed into   systems engineering    Others emphasized sociological and qualitative approaches  and found that their closest kin could be found among scholars in science  technology  and society departments   Citation needed date September 2010   \n  \n During the 1970s and 1980s  leading universities in the US  UK  and Europe began drawing these various components together in new  interdisciplinary programs  For example  in the 1970s  Cornell University developed a new program that united science studies and policy oriented scholars with historians and philosophers of science and technology  Each of these programs developed unique identities due to variation in the components that were drawn together  as well as their location within the various universities  For example  the University of Virginia \' s STS program united scholars drawn from a variety of fields  with particular strength in the history of technology   however  the program \' s teaching responsibilities   it is located within an engineering school and teaches ethics to undergraduate engineering students   means that all of its faculty share a strong interest in engineering ethics   citation needed date October 2011   \n  \n    The  quot turn to technology quot   and beyond     \n   see also Social construction of technology   \n  \n A decisive moment in the development of STS was the mid 1980s addition of technology studies to the range of interests reflected in science    During that decade  two works appeared  \'  \' en seriatim \'  \'  that signaled what   Steve Woolgar   was to call the  quot turn to technology quot     \'  \' Social Shaping of Technology \'  \'   MacKenzie and Wajcman  1985  and  \'  \' The Social Construction of Technological Systems \'  \'   Bijker  Hughes and Pinch  1987   MacKenzie and   Judy Wajcman Wajcman   primed the pump by publishing a collection of articles attesting to the influence of society on technological design  In a seminal article    Trevor Pinch   and   Wiebe Bijker   attached all the legitimacy of the Sociology of Scientific Knowledge to this development by showing how the sociology of technology could proceed along precisely the theoretical and methodological lines established by the sociology of scientific knowledge  This was the intellectual foundation of the field they called the social construction of technology  \n  \n The  quot turn to technology quot  helped to cement an already growing awareness of underlying unity among the various emerging STS programs  More recently  there has been an associated turn to ecology  nature  and materiality in general  whereby the socio technical and natural material co produce each other  This is especially evident in work in STS analyses of biomedicine  such as   Carl May      Annemarie Mol    Nelly Oudshoorn  and Andrew Webster  and ecological interventions  such as   Bruno Latour      Sheila Jasanoff    Matthias Gross    S  Lochlann Jain    and Jens Lachmund   \n  \n   Professional associations   \n The subject has several professional associations  \n  \n Founded in 1975  the   Society for Social Studies of Science    initially provided scholarly communication facilities   including a journal   \'  \' Science  Technology  and Human Values \'  \'   and annual meetings   that were mainly attended by science studies scholars  but the society has since grown into the most important professional association of science and technology studies scholars worldwide  The Society for Social Studies of Science members also include government and industry officials concerned with research and development as well as science and technology policy  scientists and engineers who wish to better understand the social embeddedness of their professional practice  and citizens concerned about the impact of science and technology in their lives  Proposals have been made to add the word  quot technology quot  to the association \' s name  thereby reflecting its stature as the leading STS professional society    According to whom but there seems to be widespread sentiment date November 2013   that the name is long enough as it is  \n  \n In   Europe    the European Association for the Study of Science and Technology  EASST  lt ref gt  http   www easst net  European Association for the Study of Science and Technology   lt  ref gt   was founded in 1981 to  \'  \' stimulate communication  exchange and collaboration in the field of studies of science and technology \'  \'   Similarly  the   European Inter University Association on Society  Science and Technology    ESST  researches and studies science and technology in society  in both historical and contemporary perspectives  \n  \n In Asia several STS associations exist  \n In   Japan    the Japanese Society for Science and Technology Studies  JSSTS  lt ref gt  http   jssts jp content section 14 51  Japanese Society for Science and Technology Studies  lt  ref gt  was founded in 2001  The Asia Pacific Science Technology  amp  Society Network  APSTSN  lt ref gt  http   apstsn org  Asia Pacific Science Technology  amp  Society Network  lt  ref gt  primarily has members from Australasia  Southeast and East Asia and Oceania  \n  \n Founded in 1958  the   Society for the History of Technology   initially attracted members from the history profession who had interests in the contextual history of technology  After the  quot turn to technology quot  in the mid 1980s  the society \' s well regarded journal   \'  \' Technology and Culture \'  \'   and its annual meetings began to attract considerable interest from non historians with technology studies interests  \n  \n Less identified with STS  but also of importance to many STS scholars in the US  are the   History of Science Society    the   Philosophy of Science Association    and the American Association for the History of Medicine  In addition  there are significant STS oriented special interest groups within major disciplinary associations  including the   American Anthropological Association    the   American Political Science Association    and the   American Sociological Association    \n  \n   Journals   \n  \n   Wikipedia Notability  academic journals  Notable   peer reviewed journals in STS

significant differences from  \' traditional \'  buildings are necessary  At a depth of about   convert 20 ft m 1   in the soil  the temperature is naturally stable within a year round range  lt ref

' \n  \'  \'  \' Future technology \'  \'  \'  is beyond the reality of science and technology  Future technology is completely and essentially different with   High Tech high tech    the latest   technology   and   State of the art cutting edge   technology   The latter represents just an advanced human invention created and been able to master and use recently  Future technology emphasizes human expectations or unforeseen things  which have not yet been invented or used  Only in a certain period  human beings maybe master and use future technology  Where is the development of future technology  How will the future technology exist  We look at several aspects to think about the future development of technology  Of course  this is inseparable from our current life  Future technology largely focus on implementing real time scenario  It shapes different fields like    medical technology    business technology    educational technology   and   green technology   with suitable applications  \n  \n   Screen world   \n The ubiquitous screen will profoundly change the people  culture and business  citation needed date July 2013    The impact of screen media and interactive window has not been released  We can imagine that the   touch screen   will play a much more important role in our life  The touch screen can bring us to have perfect communications with the real world  With the development of the   science   and   technology    it will make a great convenience in our daily life  We can use a multi functional screen device to deal with our daily schedule  It can tell us the weather and give us an advice about the dress when we get up a new day  We can use the device to control our   washing machines    to prepare a healthy breakfast  \n  \n After breakfast  we sit in our cars and tell the vehicle systems our destination   the car will then take us there itself  During our work we will have a   TV   meeting with classmates in some other places  What surround us are many high tech devices with a touch screen  It makes a great improve in our work efficiency  After the work  we can choose to play a virtual game  The touch screen will give us a real experience and we can control the game role with our whole body  As the touch screen can take a great communication with our idea  we will surround by many more screen  The huge influence will bring us a much more convenient life  \n  \n   Further natural interaction   \n   Touch      voice   are still the preliminary stage of   human computer interaction    There will be many surprising applications waiting for us  such as when you look at the screen  it in fact can see you  know your status  and constantly optimize learning  providing more in line with your service  Technology evolved as a living entity is in duty bound to weaken the ability of human rejection  We know the computer will be more and more intelligent  and the intelligence will be reflected in the human computer interaction  Beyond our reality  future interaction will be much more actual and useful  The machine can give us   3D computer graphics 3 D   virtual scene simulating the real surroundings  and then we can take what we need For example  we will not need to spend much time in choosing the clothes  An interactive machine can give us a 3 D virtual scene  where we can choose various clothes  Future interaction will have much more intelligence  \n  \n   Big data stream   \n In the future  people will live in a communicative society  We can get what we want from the social net  We like to share with the whole world  and then endless data between people  things and things will  quot float quot  around us  Their integration and convergence will change our living conditions  The share tide and future interaction will bring us a large date to process  The information society will process more and more data  and we need efficient instruments to deal with the big data  What will the big data bring us  Big data represents our past  It records what we have experienced  If we deal with the big date effectively  we will solve many potential problems  Through integrating and analyzing the big date  we can make new value  \n  \n   Access rather than ownership   \n The concept of possession has changed  We will not need to buy any book  any music and any general device  Digitization prefers access right to the concept of ownership  In the future  the service will be concentrate  Many people will not have to possess almost everything  We use a portable device to get music  videos  books and many others from the Internet  As for the users  it cost much less money and take us little time to get what we want  So it is very convenient  \n  \n   Value shift   \n We will not get the harvest value by mass copy and selling copies  Value will not exist in copies themselves  but rather the satisfaction of customer value  Such as cellphones do not need money  but date flow gets money  The value is not to create value in kind  but rather to create a  quot communication quot  user value  We will not have to pay for the electric charge  net cost  and device outlay apart  We use everything  and we pay for the service once  We will not need so many facilitators  and the service become simple  The value exists in our satisfaction  \n  \n   External

The discrete construction of reversibly assembled cellular composites introduces a new degree of freedom that determines global functional properties from the local placement of heterogeneous components  Because the individual parts are literally finite elements  a hierarchical decomposition describes the part types and their combination in a structure  lt ref name sci   gt  \n  \n RCCM can be viewed as a    digital    material in which discrete parts link with a discrete set of relative positions and orientations  An assembler can place them using only local information  Placement errors can be detected and corrected by assembly reversal  These materials combine the size and strength of composites with the low density of cellular materials and the convenience of additive manufacturing  lt ref name sci   gt  \n  \n    History    \n RCCM were introduced in 2013 by researchers at the   MIT     Center for Bits and Atoms    lt ref name kurz   gt  \n  \n    Behavior    \n  \n     Elasticity     \n RCCM lattices behave as an elastic solid in both   tension  physics  tension   and   compression  physics  compression    They offer both a linear regime and a nonlinear super elastic deformation mode a modulus an order of magnitude breater than for an ultralight material  12 3 megapascals at a density of 7 2 amp nbsp mg per cubic centimeter   Bulk properties can be predicted from component measurements and deformation modes determined by the placement of part types  Site locations are locally constrained  yielding structures that merge desirable features of   carbon fiber     composite material composites      cellular material  s and   additive manufacturing    lt ref name sci   gt  \n  \n Nonlinear elastic behavior derives from a multi axial elastic instability of the lattice  a complex coordinated elastic buckling of the strut members  The resulting geometry is similar to a   Jahn   Teller effect Jahn   Teller   distortion of an octahedral complex with respect to orientation about the octahedral centers  Elastic folding or pleating can occur in three dimensions  likely a coordinated antisymmetric twisting stress response and or plastic deformation  lt ref name sci   gt  lt ref name supp   gt  \n  \n     Failure     \n Unlike conventional composites  which typically fail catastrophically  RCCM fail incrementally because of the non linear deformation phase and the multiplicity of joints and links  These results matched   finite element method finite element   simulations lt ref gt   ANSYS   software lt  ref gt  with finely meshed rigid body models  In addition to convergence to the observed coordinated buckling mode  these simulations accurately predict the relative strength scaling observed in load test experiments  These results are consistent with the observation that open cell lattice materials fail through micro structural strut bending failures with   max      The simulations also suggest that the coordinated buckling phenomenon as well as the modulus measurements are not dominated by edge effects  with minimal influence on overall results beyond characteristic lengths exceeding several units  lt ref name sci   gt  \n  \n Varying the locations of more and less rigid elements can trigger pure axial compression  simple uni directional Euler buckling and complex buckling  lt ref name sci   gt  lt ref name supp   gt  \n  \n     Scaling     \n Cellular composites extend stretch dominated lattices to the ultralight regime  below ten milligrams per cubic centimeter   Performance depends positively on the framework rigidity of the lattice  node connectivity  slenderness of strut members and the scaling of the density cost of mechanical connections  lt ref name sci   gt  \n  \n Conventional fiber composites make   truss   cores and structural frames  with bonded assembly of substructures or continuous fiber winding  Examples of such truss cores have been reported with continuous two dimensional  2D  geometric symmetry and nearly ideal but highly   anisotropic   specific modulus scaling  \n  \n Three dimensional open cell lattice materials occur in natural and engineered systems  spanning many length scales  Their mechanical properties scale with relative density according to the geometry  They display either stretch dominated or transverse beam bending dominated microstructural behavior  based on periodic mechanical models  For   Young   s modulus   E  ideal stretch dominated scaling with density    follows a proportional law E       while common   stochastic     foam  s follow a quadratic law E     2 otherwise associated with transverse beam bending dominated behavior  At ultralight densities a further reduced cubic scaling law E     3 is common  such as with   aerogel  s and aerogel composites  lt ref name sci   gt  \n  \n The dependence of scaling on geometry is seen in periodic lattice based materials that have nearly ideal E      scaling  with high node connectedness relative to stochastic foams  These structures have previously been implemented only in relatively dense engineered materials  For the ultralight regime the E     2 scaling seen in denser stochastic cellular materials applies to electroplated tubular nickel micro lattices  as well as carbon based open cell stochastic foams  including carbon microtube

  which scale with the strut \' s cross sectional area     is low for ultralight materials  where strut diameter dominates mass density scaling  The relative density       s  of these materials is the sum of the relative density contribution of the strut members    m   s  and the relative density contribution of the connections    c   s   The strut members have a thickness t and length l  The connections transfer forces through load bearing surface contacts  requiring that the characteristic dimensions of the connections scale with the cross section of the attached strut members  t2

connected octahedrons  similar to the   perovskite   mineral structure provides a regular   polyhedron polyhedral   unit cell that satisfies   structural rigidity Maxwell   s rigidity criterion   and has a coordination number z of eight  The dependence of the relative density on the coordination number is small relative to the dependence on strut diameter  Winding the reinforcing fibers around the connection holes optimizes their load bearing capacity  while coupling them to struts which themselves retain uniaxial fiber orientation  lt ref name sci   gt  \n  \n    Comparison with traditional composite materials    \n Carbon fiber reinforced   composite material  s can improve efficiency in engineered systems  for example    airframe  s  by reducing structural weight for given strength and stiffness requirements  but present challenges with manufacturing and certification  High performance composite components employ many continuous fibers that span the shape of a component  and are embedded in a   resin   matrix  Such parts typically require custom tooling  pressurization for consolidation and heated curing  Joining such parts adds complexity and structural vulnerabilities  lt ref name sci   gt  \n  \n RCCM eliminate the need for custom tooling because parts can be incrementally added removed  Their construction  modification  repair and re use can all employ the same reversible linking process  Heterogeneous elements can be incorporated in structures with functions determined by their relative placement  Exact assembly of discrete cellular composites offers new properties and performance not available with the analog alternatives of continuously depositing or removing material  lt ref name sci   gt  \n  \n    References    \n   reflist   \n  \n    External

 Participants are not expected to deliver a highly sophisticated final product  thus  critical making can ease hesitant individuals into becoming acquainted with intimidating hardwares and software  \n  \n Often  critical making is done in small groups which supports discussion  Participants can leverage the particular skill set of each group member in the wider group effort  Critical making provides obvious opportunity to kinesthetic learners who thrive in hands on situations  however  critical making could also benefit students who learn best while listening  Those who learn via written text could be an asset to the greater group in their ability to explain concepts from the consulted literature relevant to the making activity  \n  \n    Practice    \n   File Critical making process

Speculative design is an approach to design that emphasizes inquiry  experimentation  and expression  over usability  usefulness or desirability  A particular characteristic of speculative design is that it tends to be future oriented  However this should not be mistaken as being fantasy like sense  suggesting  that is    unreal    and therefore dismissible  DiSalvo and Lukens  2009      lt ref

ijlm a 00080   lt  ref gt  \n  \n The term speculative design involves practices from various disciplines  including visionary or futurist forms of architecture  design fiction  and critical design or design for debate instead of referring a specific movement or style  More than just diagrams of unbuilt structures  spectacular design aims to explore the space of interaction between culture  technology  and the built environment  Lukens and DiSalvo  2012  p  amp nbsp 25  Practitioners of speculative design engage in design  as a sort of provocation  one that asks uncomfortable questions about the long term implications  of technology  These practices also integrate pairs  of concerns that are traditionally separate  such as fact and fiction  science and art  and commerce and academia  This provocation extends to questions about design itself  \n  \n       3D printing 3D Printing   and Critical Making     \n 3D Printing allows for relatively cheap and customizable design of objects which are often integrated into critical making projects  \n There are two type of industrial manufacturing  subtractive Manufacturing  involves shaping a material through a process of chipping   removing some of its substance  think whittling a figure out of wood  and additive Manufacturing  creates by adding material into a product  The basic steps of 3D printing are digital design  design the object you want to print using digital design software OR download a design from a website  like Thingiverse  for example   press print and the printer will begin creating a physical version of your digital design  3D printers use layerization to create objects  3D printers use a variety of materials to create objects  including plastic  metal and nylon  Flemming  What is 3D printing    The Makerbot  for example  uses polylactic acid  PLA    a substance derived from corn  The coiled PLA filament is pulled into the machine via a tube and then heated up by the extruder  causing the PLA to melt  This melted material forms the model   s layers  which is applied in approximately  02   1 millimeter layers  The model is built up until it is finished  \n  \n    The Future    \n  \n The concept of critical making is fairly new  The popularity of its  http   criticalmaking com matt ratto critical making labs  suggests the importance of developing better open source hardware and

west of   Saaremaa   island  Estonia  on September 20th 1914  His father  Alexander Hint  was a sailor and a member of the government in the first Estonian Republic  and belonged to the commission that decided on the design for the official   Estonian flag    His mother  Mare Hint  was a housewife  He had two brothers and a sister  His brother  Aadu Hint  Adolf Edmund Hint   became an acknowledged writer in the Soviet Union  His other brother  Konstantin Hint  studied science at Tallinn \' s Technology University  His sister  Amanda Hint  was a pedagogue  In 1933 Johannes graduated from Saaremaa Gymnasium with a concentration in science  From 1933 to 1934  he undertook an undergraduate degree in   mathematics   at the prestigious   Tartu   likool      Tartu University     and from 1935 to 1936 he continued his studies in the same   technology   department  majoring in   building technology    In 1941 he graduated as a   building engineer   from Tallinn \' s Polytechnic

university and attended a student gathering in 1938   the night sky was covered with stars  Johannes engaged Helju in a conversation about the stars and astrology  which he took a high interest in  They married in 1939 and had three children named Anne  Reino and Pille  \n  \n   Career   \n  \n From 1961 1966 Hint was the head of operations of The Soviet Union Institute of technological research and projects of Silikatsiit  Silicalcite Laprex  and between 1974 1981 the head of the construction and technological limited company Desintegraator  Disintegrator   which he established  Desintegraator  Disintegrator  joined forces with Austrian company Simmering Graz Paucker in 1977 and together they established an international company  quot Dessim quot   which was the first and possibly only successfully ran business collaboration between the Soviet Union and the Western World  \n  \n   Scientific activity   \n  \n Johannes Hint experimented for decades with Rotary Impact Mill or Contra Rotating Mill   Disintegrator  The Disintegrator processed the mixture by fine grinding and mechanical activation of material components with water  which further strengthened autoclave effects  Silicatsite  Laprex  factories were opened initially in Estonia but then all over the Soviet Union as well as in Japan and Italy  His companies and organizations didn \' t only concentrate on building materials but also manufactured and distributed universal disintegrator activator and UDA technology   \n  \n From 1978   1981  the Disintegrator began trial production of biotechnological products  Especially popular were food preparations that contained bio active substances  which although sometimes regarded as  quot quack remedies quot  were distributed  not only across the Soviet Union  but also to the western world   The medical qualities and effects of two of the preparations  AU 8  for internal use  and L 1  for external application   were identified after Johannes Hint had been rehabilitated and production had been stopped  At a later date these preparations would have been widely acknowledged as food preservatives  as journalist Siim Kallas confirmed in his 1988 article published in  quot Rahva H    l quot   since similar biological samples heralded the nutrition therapy boom in the West a few years later  \n  \n   Political activity   \n  \n Johannes Hint was a member of the Estonian Communist Party between 1941 and 1943  He was persuaded by his brother Aadu Hint  who later became a famous author in the Soviet Union  to join the party  In 1943  he was arrested by the Nazis who were occupying Estonia  as Hint was blacklisted as a communist  he was put to Nazi concentration camp in Estonia to await his execution  Hint managed to escape the camp and flee to nearby Helsinki  Finland on a little fisher boat  crossing the Gulf of Finland in the middle of the night  His plan was to flee to nearby neutral Sweden as Finland was allied with the Nazi Germany at the time but failed to do so and was arrested in Helsinki and put to war prisoners    camp \n He was returned to his native Estonia after the end of Second World War  Estonia was now occupied by the Soviet Union  By the end of 1960 \' s Johannes had become deeply disappointed in the Soviet political system  and became  what can be described as a  quot free mind quot   keeping a unique individualism and distance from the political and social ideologies of the communist regime  He was openly vocal to his friends and co workers about his feelings of disfavor regarding the Soviet Rule  Johannes Hint also had connections with the members of underground resistance  the Estonian Democratic Movement  \n  \n   Death   \n  \n On 13 November 1981  Johannes Hint was arrested by

' \n   Use of Technology to Improve Products and Processes   \n One of the most widely used definitions of advanced   manufacturing   involves the use of   technology   to improve products and or processes  with the relevant technology being described as    advanced        innovative     or       wikt cutting edge cutting edge       For example  one organization defines advanced manufacturing as industries that    increasingly integrate new innovative technologies in both products and processes  The rate of   Technology adoption lifecycle technology adoption   and the ability to use that technology to remain competitive and add value define the advanced manufacturing sector     lt ref gt  Virginia Beach Economic Development Department  www yesvirginiabeach com business sectors pages

number of organizations also included   business   or   management   methodologies in their definition of advanced manufacturing  For example  one organization defines    advanced manufacturing as the insertion of new technology  improved processes  and management methods to improve the manufacturing of products      National Defense University  2002  as reported in PCAST   Another organization lists advanced manufacturing as    encompassing   lean production   techniques  enhanced supply chain integration  and technology assimilation     lt ref gt  Virginia Beach Economic Development Department  Website at  lt www yesvirginiabeach com business sectors pages advanced manufacturing aspx gt   lt  ref gt  In fact  the Wikipedia definition of    advanced manufacturing    is    advanced

business or management methodologies were listed as being a part of advanced manufacturing  \n  \n     Quality control  s  US Department of Labor  \n   Lean production technologies  \n     Supply

converting raw materials into finished products by using manual or mechanized transformational techniques  The purpose of such activities is to add value to achieve targeted objectives  which do not preclude society   s overall interests  In one report  the distinction between traditional sectors of manufacturing  listed as auto  steel  and others  listed as   aerospace      medical device      pharmaceutical    is the basis for a definition of advanced manufacturing  with the characteristics of the two differing in terms of volume and scale economies  labor and skill content  and the depth and diversity of the network surrounding the industry   New England Council and Deloitte  as referenced in PCAST document  \n  \n    Successful Manufacturers    \n Other sources define advanced manufacturers as those that    succeed    in today   s competitive environment  One source states that     What differentiates certain companies is a unique ability to create a competitive advantage in this environment  These manufacturers think and do faster and  by definition  these advantages make them advanced        Industrial College of the Armed Forces     The White House survey lists some experts as defining advanced manufacturing    solely by advances that led to decreased cost or increased   productivity        PCAST  \n  \n    Research and Development    \n One organization listed    aggressive   research and development      as being part of the definition of advanced manufacturing     Purdue University     Although research and development was not explicitly included in most definitions  the innovative technologies listed by many are most likely the result of extensive research and development  Development of a sound product  which satisfies given criteria with least pain  is a common challenge  most unusually  haunting the manufacturer  The domain of competition is quite large because manufacturers compete at inter manufacturing and intra firm levels  producing near net products  The customer desires a component which promises functions most reliably  while addressing socio techno environmental attributes  lt ref gt Thareja Priyavrat   quot Competitive Foundry Through Integration of TIPS  Technology  Innovation  Product Design  and Process Systems  quot   Trends in Mechanical Engineering  amp  Technology  Vol 1  No 2   3  2011  lt  ref gt  \n  \n   Dynamic  Constantly Changing   \n Finally  several sources pointed out that any definition of advanced manufacturing will need to change with the changing times  and that the definition will vary for different companies and different industries  The White House survey states     Most discussants agree that an appropriate advanced manufacturing definition should be dynamic in nature and be treated as more of a   benchmarking benchmark    That is  there is a constant iteration of improving manufacturing frontiers   Therefore  what is classified as    frontier    is constantly changing  and  likewise  advanced manufacturing is constantly changing      PCAST   Another source stated that     Advanced manufacturing is like a   chameleon    It changes in response to the needs of whichever company has incorporated it into its manufacturing process      St  Louis  C B  Adams  A final expert is quoted as saying     Advanced manufacturing  by its very nature  defies definition  because it is going to be different for the   chemical industry   than it is for the metal fabrication industry and any other industry      Tom White  as quoted by C B  Adams  \n  \n   Conclusion   \n The term    advanced manufacturing    encompasses many of the developments in the manufacturing field during the late 20th and early 21st centuries  including high tech products and processes and lean  green  and flexible manufacturing  among others  No one definition captures everything said about advanced manufacturing  although the majority of definitions found on the web include the use of innovative technology to improve products and or processes  and many also include the use of new business management methodologies  Accordingly  the definition that probably comes closest to being comprehensive is that given by Paul Fowler of the National Association of Advanced Manufacturing  NACFAM   celebrating its 20th anniversary this year  \n  \n    The Advanced Manufacturing entity makes extensive use of computer  high precision  and information technologies integrated with a high performance workforce in a production system capable of furnishing a heterogeneous mix of products in small or large volumes with both the efficiency of   mass production   and the flexibility of custom manufacturing in order to respond quickly to customer demands      Quoted in PCAST    quot In foreseeable future categorical

\n  \n     Rebuildable atomizers     \n A rebuildable atomizer or an RBA is an atomizer that allows the user to assemble or  quot build quot  the wick and coil themselves instead of replacing them by an   wikt off the shelf off the shelf   atomizer  quot head quot   They also allow the user to build atomizers at any desired electrical resistance  The materials needed to  quot rebuild quot  the atomizers are usually much cheaper than the usual prefabricated replaceable wick and coil assemblies destined to clearomizers  \n  \n These atomizers are divided into two main categories  rebuildable tank atomizers  RTA \' s  and rebuildable dripping atomizers  RDA \' s   \n  \n Rebuildable tank atomizers or RTA \' s are similar to clearomizers in that they use a tank or container to hold and bring liquid to the coil  They usually hold a lot more e liquid than their RDA counterparts  \n  \n Rebuildable dripping atomizers or RDA \' s on the other hand lack the container section and hold very little liquid compared to RTA \' s but are usually a lot smaller  They usually consist only of an atomizer  quot building deck quot  which can accept one or more coils and a  quot top cap quot  to cover the coils where a mouth piece can be attached  The user needs to manually keep the atomizer wet by dripping liquid on the bare wick and coil assembly  hence their name  \n  \n     Power     \n Most portable devices contain a   rechargeable battery    which tends to be the largest component of an electronic cigarette  The battery may contain an electronic airflow sensor whereby activation is triggered simply by drawing breath through the device  while other models employ a power button that must be held during operation  An LED to indicate activation may also be employed  Some manufacturers also offer a cigarette pack shaped portable charging case  PCC   which contains a larger battery capable of charging e cigarettes  Devices aimed at more experienced users may sport additional features  such as variable power output and support of a wide range of internal batteries and atomizer configurations and tend to stray away from the cigarette form factor  Some cheaper recent devices use an   electret microphone   with a custom IC to detect airflow and indicate   Battery  electricity  battery   status on the included blue LED  lt ref gt   cite web   url http   www

'  \n The fast paced development of the digital world in the twenty first century has contributed to the   digital divide   becoming a very real problem for a segment of the population for whom a lack of education of  interest in or access to digital devices has left them excluded from the technological world and fearful of its growing omnipresence  \n  \n Digital phobic is part of a growing dictionary of digital vocabulary exploring the social impact of the technological age   The phrase considers the fears associated with technological evolution and change  and acknowledges the possibility of exclusion as a result of a rising reliance on technology in day to day life  \n  \n   Discourse   \n Everyday use of technology has increased dramatically since the turn of the century  having a significant impact upon both those embracing technological change as well as those reluctant to be a part of it  \n  \n A sharp rise in technological innovations during the twenty first century has been responsible for changing much of the way we work  socialise  and learn   all of which can be at the foundation of distrust in the technological age   Psychologists  academics and researchers have begun to consider the base of these fears and consider the social  cultural and environmental circumstances which might catalyse someone to becoming    digital phobic     \n  \n   Technophobia   is used to discuss a fear of advanced technology in a formal capacity and can stem from a number  and combination of  concerns   With the oncoming of the   digital age    worries have broadened from the very earliest fears that technology would eradicate artisanship to concerns over data protection  financial security  identity theft  technical inability and invasion of privacy  \n  \n There is no exhaustible list of reasons cited for fearing the digital world and  whilst research into both the cause and consequence of developing a digital phobia remains in its infancy  the presence of digital phobia regardless contributes towards an increasingly comprehensive picture of a series of profiles amongst digital users  \n   \n Recent research from Foresters  the international financial services organisation  found 2  of the UK population to fall into this category of internet user lt ref gt http   www independent co uk life style gadgets and tech news digital addict  or

percentage of users in development of a digital phobia increase  with 4  fearful of online shopping for worrying that someone will steal their card details  and 12  fearful that using social media will make it easier for people to find their personal details  \n  \n When asked to reason their attitude towards technology as part of this survey  a larger percentage of the UK population were revealed to be fearful of the impact it could be having on more traditional means of doing things  31  believed technology was preventing us from communicating properly  while 32  thought advances in technology will result in long held traditions being lost  \n  \n This fear has only been exacerbated over time as more and more data holding  services and opportunities are transferred to the digital realm  and both the perceived and real nature of security and vulnerability risks increases   Worrying levels of time spent on devices  the invasion of privacy or the possible misuse or abuse of personal data entrusted to online sources are all contributing towards the development of a digital phobia amongst a proportion of the population  \n  \n Concerns about the negative  exclusionary or divisive consequences of living within a digital society are being voiced from various global platforms    April 2014 research conducted by Pew Research Center  in association with Smithsonian Magazine  revealed concerns about anticipated technological developments over the next half century   30  of Americans surveyed feared that technological changes would lead to a future in which people are worse off than they are at the time of being surveyed  lt ref gt http   www pewinternet org 2014 04 17 us views of technology and the future    Aaron Smith   U S  Views of Technology and the

implications of what otherwise appears to be a positive advancement of the modern world   \n   \n This phrase has been developed by  http   www foresters com uk en Pages default aspx Foresters   the international financial services organisation  for the purpose of describing attitudes to technology amongst the UK population  \n  \n Developed within a digital vocabulary constituting of four other phrases    Digital addict    Digital Omnivore  Digital Agnostic  Digital Denier  digital phobic is part of a scale of social description for online behaviour within the digital age  \n  \n The phrase has been used as part of discussion on the more general use of technology within the twenty first century and the importance of striking a balance between time spent on and offline   Research conducted by Foresters in association with  http   techtimeout com  Tech Timeout   a social communications initiative considering the role of technology in contemporary society  formed the basis of the descriptor and identified the key traits of each type of digital user based on answers from over 1 000 UK respondents   \n   \n Both anecdotal and research based evidence suggests categories of internet use  whilst they cannot be linearly divided  are able to loosely describe attitudes to technology in society   The developed phrases are able to be used to greater understand and

phrase and definition were developed specifically from research on UK technology users  the phrase is not UK specific and is designed to be indicative of a global community of technology users who share in these characteristics  \n  \n   Social and cultural impact   \n Digital phobia presents a very real and pressing problem in the modern world where technology has become such a central and essential resource   Internet culture has developed to become a part of the fabric of everyday life and is now even considered part of the make up of national identity with a country   s internet use and digital footprint an important modern index for international comparison  often associated with development and modernity  \n  \n The consequences of non participation in the digital world are far reaching  and can affect the economic  cultural  social  occupational and educational life of a non user   For example  in 2009 Price Waterhouse Coopers estimated that UK households offline are missing out on savings of   560 a year which could be saved if shopping or paying for bills online lt ref gt http   www digitalbirmingham co uk downloads pwc report pdf   Pricewaterhouse Coopers LLP

population stems from a  for some very logical  fear of how technology is adapting the world we live in and at the pace and price with which it is doing so   With such a significance placed on online participation  concerns about the role of the internet in everyday life are not unfounded and not exclusive to those who prefer to stray away from the internet  avoid certain activities online  or use

international technology commercialization platform tailor made for R amp D results originating from Russian and CIS universities and institutes to bring innovation to the global market through the proven form of business start ups  Commercialization Reactor focuses on creating and launching start ups based on disruptive scientific ideas while providing the companies born in the Reactor with professional and comprehensive support and infrastructure tools allowing them to develop international innovative business across the whole life cycle of a start up  The main interest of the Reactor is focused on different fields of natural and life sciences  Commercialization Reactor is known for its friendly attitude towards universities and academic institutes striving to create a business ecosystem as well as to many East European and Russian universities and R amp D institutes which often lack an access to global industries and venture capital  \n  lt      Write your article below this line     gt  \n  \n   TOC   \n  \n   Format   \n Commercialization Reactor is an ongoing business workshop combining features of pre seed   Business accelerator accelerator      Seed money seed fund      business incubator      Technology brokering technology broker      Technology transfer technology transfer office      commercialization   agent of universities and educational project  The main difference from all of the above forms of support is that the model of the Commercialization Reactor implements natural forming of teams instead of selecting people from existing teams of technology enthusiasts  The ultimate requirement is that each team should have a strong scientific foundation enforced by entrepreneurial spirit which  when combined  define a path to success  Consequently  identifying team players and team building is one of the core activities of Commercialization Reactor  Commercialization of science based innovations is of course higher risk with a longer time line  and cost then IT   web based or sustaining innovation projects  Therefore  unlike traditional accelerators  which select projects with already formed business models and teams  Commercialization Reactor selects scientific   engineering ideas and develops them by adding and coaching business teams and by providing initial investment  \n  \n   Programme   \n  \n Commercialization Reactor consists of a sequence of programmes  Each programme runs through a 6 month cycle  During each cycle up to 12 prominent science based ideas are selected by the evaluation committee for participation in an Ignition Event  At this event the  pre screened scientists present their ideas according to a given standard and meet entrepreneurs who are interested in developing scientific ideas into business  Over an initial three months period  teams are built and a 10 week compulsory educational Start up Support Programme is held  The Start up Support Programme culminates with a Performance Day on which the projects are presented to venture investors and business angels  \n  \n Beyond Performance Day  the staff of Commercialization Reactor tracks each companies \'  development regardless of whether or not any investment had been secured during the Performance Day  Companies which fail to obtain financial support at one Demo day  can attend subsequent Demo Day events  Once a company has successfully raised seed capital they remain residents and gain access to all of Commercialization Reactor facilities and opportunities  \n  \n   History   \n  \n Commercialization Reactor originated out of international efforts to commercialize former   USSR     science   based   Technology technologies   funded mostly by the EU and USA via the    International Science and Technology Center ISTC    These efforts recognized the prominent   Soviet science scientific and technological heritage of the Soviet Union   and it \' s outstanding commercial potential appreciated by entrepreneurs and investors  but lacking an effective mechanism of deal flow developed since the collapse of the Soviet System  \n  \n Nikolai Adamovich  founder of the Commercialization Reactor  originated the concept as a vehicle to support the ISTC Commercialization efforts   The first Ignition Event was held in   Riga      Latvia   in 2009 with extensive support from ISTC and   LIAA    \n  \n   Performance   \n Since 2009 companies of Commercialization Reactor have raised in total over EUR 3 million in pre sed and seed capital  lt ref gt   cite web

prototype active systems  The British tested their ASDIC on   HMS Antrim 1903 6   in 1920  and started production in 1922  The 6th Destroyer Flotilla had ASDIC equipped vessels in 1923  An anti submarine school    RNAS Portland  HMS Osprey  HMS  \'  \' Osprey \'  \'     and a training   flotilla   of four vessels were established on   Isle of Portland Portland   in 1924  The US Sonar QB set arrived in 1931  \n  \n By the outbreak of   World War II    the   Royal Navy   had five sets for different surface ship classes  and others for submarines  incorporated into a complete anti submarine attack system  The effectiveness of early ASDIC was hamstrung by the use of the   depth charge   as an anti submarine weapon  This required an attacking vessel to pass over a submerged contact before dropping charges over the stern  resulting in a loss of ASDIC contact in the moments leading up to attack  The hunter was effectively firing blind  during which time a submarine commander could take evasive action  This situation was remedied by using several ships cooperating and by the adoption of  quot ahead throwing weapons quot   such as   Hedgehog  weapon  Hedgehog   and later   Squid  weapon  Squid    which projected warheads at a target ahead of the attacker and thus still in ASDIC contact  Developments during the war resulted in British ASDIC sets which used several different shapes of beam  continuously covering blind spots  Later  acoustic torpedoes were used  \n  \n At the start of   World War II    British ASDIC technology was   Tizard Mission transferred for free   to the United States  Research on ASDIC and underwater sound was expanded in the UK and in the US  Many new types of military sound detection were developed  These included   sonobuoy  s  first developed by the British in 1944 under the   codename    \'  \' High Tea \'  \'   dipping dunking sonar and   mine detection   sonar  This work formed the basis for post war developments related to countering the   nuclear submarine    Work on sonar had also been carried out in the Axis countries  notably in Germany  which included countermeasures  At the end of World War II this German work was assimilated by Britain and the US  Sonars have continued to be developed by many countries  including Russia  for both military and civil uses  In recent years the major military development has been the increasing interest in low frequency active systems  \n  \n     SONAR     \n During the 1930s American engineers developed their own underwater sound detection technology and important discoveries were made  such as   thermocline  s  that would help future development  lt ref gt  http   earlyradiohistory us 1963hw39 htm Sonar  lt  ref gt   After technical information was exchanged between the two countries during the Second World War  Americans began to use the term  \'  \' SONAR \'  \'  for their systems  coined as the equivalent of   Radar RADAR    \n  \n    Active sonar    \n   Unreferenced section date January 2009   \n   Image Sonar Principle EN svg thumb 400px Principle of an active sonar   \n Active sonar uses a sound transmitter and a receiver   When the two are in the same place it is monostatic operation   When the transmitter and receiver are separated it is bistatic operation   When more transmitters  or more receivers  are used  again spatially separated  it is multistatic operation   Most sonars are used monostatically with the same array often being used for transmission and reception   Active sonobuoy fields may be operated multistatically  \n  \n Active sonar creates a   Pulse  signal processing  pulse   of sound  often called a  quot ping quot   and then listens for   Reflection  physics  reflection  s    Echo  phenomenon  echo    of the pulse  This pulse of sound is generally created electronically using a sonar projector consisting of a signal generator  power amplifier and electro acoustic transducer array  A beamformer is usually employed to concentrate the acoustic power into a beam  which may be swept to cover the required search angles  Generally  the electro acoustic transducers are of the   Tonpilz   type and their design may be optimised to achieve maximum efficiency over the widest bandwidth  in order to optimise performance of the overall system  Occasionally  the acoustic pulse may be created by other means  e g   1  chemically using explosives  or  2  airguns or  3  plasma sound sources  \n  \n To measure the distance to an object  the time from transmission of a pulse to reception is measured and converted into a range by knowing the speed of sound   To measure the   bearing  navigation  bearing    several   hydrophone  s are used  and the set measures the relative arrival time to each  or with an array of hydrophones  by measuring the relative amplitude in beams formed through a process called   beamforming     Use of an array reduces the spatial response so that to provide wide cover   multibeam echosounder multibeam   systems are used  The target signal  if present  together with noise is then passed through various forms of   Sonar signal processing signal processing    which for simple sonars may be just energy measurement   It is then presented to some form of decision device that calls the output either the required signal or noise   This decision device may be an operator with headphones or a display  or in more sophisticated sonars this function may be carried out by software   Further processes may be carried out to classify the target and localise it  as well as measuring its velocity  \n  \n The pulse may be at constant   frequency   or a   chirp   of changing frequency  to allow   pulse compression   on reception   Simple sonars generally use the former with a filter wide enough to cover possible Doppler changes due to target movement  while more complex ones generally include the latter technique   Since   digital processing   became available   pulse compression   has usually been implemented using digital correlation techniques   Military sonars often have multiple beams to provide all round cover while simple ones only cover a narrow arc  although the beam may be rotated  relatively slowly  by mechanical scanning  \n  \n Particularly when single frequency transmissions are used  the   Doppler effect   can be used to measure the radial speed of a target   The difference in frequency between the transmitted and received signal is measured and converted into a velocity   Since Doppler shifts can be introduced by either receiver or target motion  allowance has to be made for the radial speed of the searching platform  \n  \n One useful small sonar is similar in appearance to a waterproof flashlight  The head is pointed into the water  a button is pressed  and the device displays the distance to the target  Another variant is a  quot   fishfinder   quot  that shows a small display with   Shoaling and schooling shoal  s of fish  Some civilian sonars  which are not designed for stealth  approach active military sonars in capability  with quite exotic three dimensional displays of the area near the boat  \n  \n When active sonar is used to measure the distance from the transducer to the bottom  it is known as   echo sounding     Similar methods may be used looking upward for wave measurement  \n  \n Active sonar is also used to measure distance through water between two sonar transducers or a combination of a hydrophone  underwater acoustic microphone  and projector  underwater acoustic speaker   A transducer is a device that can transmit and receive acoustic signals   quot pings quot    When a hydrophone transducer receives a specific interrogation signal it responds by transmitting a specific reply signal  To measure distance  one transducer projector transmits an interrogation signal and measures the time between this transmission and the receipt of the other transducer hydrophone reply  The time difference  scaled by the speed of sound through water and divided by two  is the distance between the two platforms  This technique  when used with multiple transducers hydrophones projectors  can calculate the relative positions of static and moving objects in water  \n  \n In combat situations  an active pulse can be detected by an opponent and will reveal a submarine \' s position  \n  \n A very directional  but low efficiency  type of sonar  used by fisheries  military  and for port security  makes use of a complex nonlinear feature of water known as non linear sonar  the virtual transducer being known as a  \'  \'   parametric array   \'  \'   \n  \n   Listen filename Sonar pings ogg title Sonar pings description Recording of active SONAR pings  format   ogg     \n  \n     Project ARTEMIS     \n   Project ARTEMIS   was a one of a kind low frequency sonar for surveillance that was deployed off Bermuda for several years in the early 1960s  The active portion was deployed from a World War II tanker  and the receiving array was a built into a fixed position on an offshore bank  \n  \n     Transponder     \n This is an active sonar device that receives a stimulus and immediately  or with a delay  retransmits the received signal or a predetermined one  \n  \n     Performance prediction     \n A sonar target is small relative to the   sphere    centred around the emitter  on which it is located  Therefore  the power of the reflected signal is very low  several   orders of magnitude   less than the original signal  Even if the reflected signal was of the same power  the following example  using hypothetical values  shows the problem  Suppose a sonar system is capable of emitting a 10 000 W m   signal at 1 m  and detecting a 0 001 W m   signal  At 100 m the signal will be 1 W m    due to the   inverse square law     If the entire signal is reflected from a 10 m   target  it will be at 0 001 W m   when it reaches the emitter  i e  just detectable  However  the original signal will remain above 0 001 W m   until 300 m  Any 10 m   target between 100 and 300 m using a similar or better system would be able to detect the pulse but would not be detected by the emitter  The detectors must be very sensitive to pick up the echoes  Since the original signal is much more powerful  it can be detected many times further than twice the range of the sonar  as in the example   \n  \n In active sonar there are two performance limitations  due to noise and reverberation   In general one or other of these will dominate so that the two effects can be initially considered separately  \n  \n In noise limited conditions at initial detection  \n      lt big gt SL     2TL   TS      NL     DI    DT lt  big gt  \n where SL is the   Underwater acoustics Source

 \n Passive sonar listens without transmitting  It is often employed in military settings  although it is also used in science applications   \'  \' e g  \'  \'   detecting fish for presence absence studies in various aquatic environments   see also   passive acoustics   and   passive radar    In the very broadest usage  this term can encompass virtually any analytical technique involving remotely generated sound  though it is usually restricted to techniques applied in an aquatic environment  \n  \n    Identifying sound sources    \n  \n Passive sonar has a wide variety of techniques for identifying the source of a detected sound  For example  U S  vessels usually operate 60   Hertz Hz     alternating current   power systems  If   transformer  s or   electrical generator generators   are mounted without proper   vibration   insulation from the   hull  watercraft  hull   or become flooded  the 60 amp nbsp Hz sound from the windings can be emitted from the   submarine   or ship  This can help to identify its nationality  as all European submarines and nearly every other nation \' s submarine have 50 amp nbsp Hz power systems  Intermittent sound sources  such as a   wrench   being dropped  may also be detectable to passive sonar   Until fairly recently   when date August 2012   an experienced  trained operator identified signals  but now computers may do this  \n  \n Passive sonar systems may have large sonic   databases    but the sonar operator usually finally classifies the signals manually  A   computer system   frequently uses these databases to identify classes of ships  actions  i e  the speed of a ship  or the type of weapon released   and even particular ships  Publications for classification of sounds are provided by and continually updated by the   Office of Naval Intelligence US Office of Naval Intelligence    \n  \n    Noise limitations    \n  \n Passive sonar on vehicles is usually severely limited because of noise generated by the vehicle  For this reason  many submarines operate   nuclear reactor  s that can be cooled without pumps  using silent   convection    or   fuel cell  s or   battery  electricity  batteries    which can also run silently  Vehicles \'    propeller  s are also designed and precisely machined to emit minimal noise  High speed propellers often create tiny bubbles in the water  and this   cavitation   has a distinct sound  \n  \n The sonar   hydrophone  s may be towed behind the ship or submarine in order to reduce the effect of noise generated by the watercraft itself  Towed units also combat the   thermocline    as the unit may be towed above or below the   thermocline    \n  \n The display of most passive sonars used to be a two dimensional   spectrogram waterfall display    The horizontal direction of the display is bearing  The vertical is frequency  or sometimes time  Another display technique is to color code frequency time information for bearing  More recent displays are generated by the computers  and mimic   radar   type   plan position indicator   displays  \n  \n    Performance prediction    \n  \n Unlike active sonar  only one way propagation is involved   Because of the different signal processing used  the minimum detectable signal to noise ratio will be different   The equation for determining the performance of a passive sonar is  \n     lt big gt SL  amp minus  TL   NL  amp minus  DI   DT lt  big gt  \n where SL is the source level  TL is the transmission loss  NL is the noise level  DI is the directivity index of the array  an approximation to the array gain  and DT is the detection threshold   The   figure of merit   of a passive sonar is  \n     lt big gt FOM   SL   DI  amp minus   NL   DT  lt  big gt   \n  \n    Performance factors    \n The detection  classification and localisation performance of a sonar depends on the environment and the receiving equipment  as well as the transmitting equipment in an active sonar or the target radiated noise in a passive sonar  \n  \n     Sound propagation     \n Sonar operation is affected by variations in   sound speed    particularly in the vertical plane  Sound travels more slowly in   fresh water   than in   sea water    though the difference is small   The speed is determined by the water \' s   bulk modulus   and   mass     density     The bulk modulus is affected by temperature  dissolved impurities  usually   salinity     and   pressure    The density effect is small   The   speed of sound    in feet per second  is approximately  \n  \n  4388    11 25  amp times  temperature  in   F      0 0182  amp times  depth  in feet     salinity  in parts per thousand    lt     Needs rephrasing  imperial system is not an international standard     gt  \n  \n This   empirical  ly derived approximation equation is reasonably accurate for normal temperatures  concentrations of salinity and the range of most ocean depths  Ocean temperature varies with depth  but at between 30 and 100 meters there is often a marked change  called the   thermocline    dividing the warmer surface water from the cold  still waters that make up the rest of the ocean  This can frustrate sonar  because a sound originating on one side of the thermocline tends to be bent  or   refraction refracted    through the thermocline  The thermocline may be present in shallower coastal waters  However  wave action will often mix the water column and eliminate the thermocline  Water   pressure   also affects sound propagation  higher pressure increases the sound speed  which causes the sound waves to refract away from the area of higher sound speed  The mathematical model of refraction is called   Snell \' s law    \n  \n If the sound source is deep and the conditions are right  propagation may occur in the  \'   SOFAR channel deep sound channel   \'   This provides extremely low propagation loss to a receiver in the channel   This is because of sound trapping in the channel with no losses at the boundaries   Similar propagation can occur in the  \' surface duct \'  under suitable conditions   However in this case there are reflection losses at the surface  \n  \n In shallow water propagation is generally by repeated reflection at the surface and bottom  where considerable losses can occur  \n  \n Sound propagation is affected by   Absorption  acoustics  absorption   in the water itself as well as at the surface and bottom   This absorption depends upon frequency  with several different mechanisms in sea water   Long range sonar uses low frequencies to minimise absorption effects  \n  \n The sea contains many sources of noise that interfere with the desired target echo or signature   The main noise sources are   waves   and   shipping     The motion of the receiver through the water can also cause speed dependent low frequency noise  \n  \n    Scattering    \n When active sonar is used    scattering   occurs from small objects in the sea as well as from the bottom and surface   This can be a major source of interference  This acoustic scattering is analogous to the scattering of the light from a car \' s headlights in fog  a high intensity pencil beam will penetrate the fog to some extent  but broader beam headlights emit much light in unwanted directions  much of which is scattered back to the observer  overwhelming that reflected from the target   quot white out quot     For analogous reasons active sonar needs to transmit in a narrow beam to minimise scattering  \n  \n    Target characteristics    \n The sound  \'  \' reflection \'  \'  characteristics of the target of an active sonar  such as a submarine  are known as its   target strength     A complication is that echoes are also obtained from other objects in the sea such as whales  wakes  schools of fish and rocks  \n  \n Passive sonar detects the target \' s  \'  \' radiated \'  \'  noise characteristics   The radiated   Frequency spectrum spectrum   comprises a   continuous spectrum   of noise with peaks at certain frequencies which can be used for classification  \n  \n    Countermeasures    \n  \'  \' Active \'  \'   powered  countermeasures may be launched by a submarine under attack to raise the noise level  provide a large false target  and obscure the signature of the submarine itself  \n  \n  \'  \' Passive \'  \'   i e   non powered  countermeasures include  \n   Mounting noise generating devices on isolating devices  \n   Sound absorbent coatings on the hulls of submarines  for example   anechoic tiles    \n  \n    Military applications    \n  \n Modern   naval warfare   makes extensive use of both passive and active sonar from water borne vessels  aircraft and fixed installations  Although active sonar was used by surface craft in   World War II    submarines avoided the use of active sonar due to the potential for revealing their presence and position to enemy forces  However  the advent of modern signal processing enabled the use of passive sonar as a primary means for search and detection operations  In 1987 a division of   Japan  ese company   Toshiba   reportedly sold machinery to the   Soviet Union   that allowed their submarine propeller blades to be milled so that they became radically quieter  making the newer generation of submarines more difficult to detect  \n  \n The use of active sonar by a submarine to determine bearing is extremely rare and will not necessarily give high quality bearing or range information to the submarines fire control team however  use of active sonar on surface ships is very common  Active sonar is used by submarines when if the tactical situation dictates it is more important to determine the position of a hostile submarine than conceal their own position  With surface ships it might be assumed that the threat is already tracking the ship with satellite data  Any vessel around the emitting sonar will detect the emission  Having heard the signal  it is easy to identify the sonar equipment used  usually with its frequency  and its position  with the sound wave \' s energy   Active sonar is similar to radar in that  while it allows detection of targets at a certain range  it also enables the emitter to be detected at a far greater range  which is undesirable  \n  \n Since active sonar reveals the presence and position of the operator  and does not allow exact classification of targets  it is used by fast  planes  helicopters  and by noisy platforms  most surface ships  but rarely by submarines  When active sonar is used by surface ships or submarines  it is typically activated very briefly at intermittent periods to minimize the risk of detection  Consequently active sonar is normally considered a backup to passive sonar  In aircraft  active sonar is used in the form of disposable   sonobuoy  s that are dropped in the aircraft \' s patrol area or in the vicinity of possible enemy sonar contacts  \n  \n Passive sonar has several advantages  Most importantly  it is silent  If the target   radiated noise level   is high enough  it can have a greater range than active sonar  and allows the target to be identified  Since any motorized object makes some noise  it may in principle be detected  depending on the level of noise emitted and the   ambient noise level   in the area  as well as the technology used  To simplify  passive sonar  quot sees quot  around the ship using it  On a submarine  nose mounted passive sonar detects in directions of about 270    centered on the ship \' s alignment  the hull mounted array of about 160   on each side  and the towed array of a full 360    The invisible areas are due to the ship \' s own interference  Once a signal is detected in a certain direction  which means that something makes sound in that direction  this is called broadband detection  it is possible to zoom in and analyze the signal received  narrowband analysis   This is generally done using a   Fourier transform   to show the different frequencies making up the sound  Since every engine makes a specific sound  it is straightforward to identify the object  Databases of unique engine sounds are part of what is known as  \'  \' acoustic intelligence \'  \'  or ACINT  \n  \n Another use of passive sonar is to determine the target \' s   trajectory    This process is called   Target Motion Analysis    TMA   and the resultant  quot solution quot  is the target \' s range  course  and speed  TMA is done by marking from which direction the sound comes at different times  and comparing the motion with that of the operator \' s own ship  Changes in relative motion are analyzed using standard geometrical techniques along with some assumptions about limiting cases  \n  \n Passive sonar is stealthy and very useful  However  it requires   high tech   electronic components and is costly  It is generally deployed on expensive ships in the form of arrays to enhance detection  Surface ships use it to good effect  it is even better used by   submarines    and it is also used by airplanes and helicopters  mostly to a  quot surprise effect quot   since submarines can hide under thermal layers  If a submarine \' s commander believes he is alone  he may bring his boat closer to the surface and be easier to detect  or go deeper and faster  and thus make more sound  \n  \n Examples of sonar applications in military use are given below   Many of the civil uses given in the following section may also be applicable to naval use  \n  \n     Anti submarine warfare     \n   Image VDS jpg thumb right Variable Depth Sonar and its winch   \n  \n Until recently  ship sonars were usually with hull mounted arrays  either amidships or at the bow   It was soon found after their initial use that a means of reducing flow noise was required   The first were made of canvas on a framework  then steel ones were used   Now domes are usually made of reinforced plastic or pressurized rubber   Such sonars are primarily active in operation   An example of a conventional hull mounted sonar is the   SQS 56    \n  \n Because of the problems of ship noise  towed sonars are also used   These also have the advantage of being able to be placed deeper in the water   However  there are limitations on their use in shallow water   These are called towed arrays  linear  or variable depth sonars  VDS  with 2 3D arrays   A problem is that the winches required to deploy recover these are large and expensive   VDS sets are primarily active in operation while towed arrays are passive  \n  \n An example of a modern active passive ship towed sonar is   Sonar 2087   made by   Thales Underwater Systems    \n  \n     Torpedoes     \n  \n Modern torpedoes are generally fitted with an active passive sonar   This may be used to home directly on the target  but wake following torpedoes are also used   An early example of an acoustic homer was the   Mark 37 torpedo    \n  \n Torpedo countermeasures can be towed or free   An early example was the German  \'  \' Sieglinde \'  \'  device while the   Bold  decoy   \'  \' Bold \'  \'    was a chemical device   A widely used US device was the towed   AN SLQ 25 Nixie   while   Mobile submarine simulator    MOSS  was a free device  A modern alternative to the Nixie system is the   SSTD UK Royal Navy S2170 Surface Ship Torpedo Defence   system  \n  \n     Mines     \n  \n Mines may be fitted with a sonar to detect  localize and recognize the required target   Further information is given in   acoustic mine   and an example is the   CAPTOR mine    \n  \n     Mine countermeasures     \n  \n Mine Countermeasure  MCM  Sonar  sometimes called  quot Mine and Obstacle Avoidance Sonar  MOAS  quot   is a specialized type of sonar used for detecting small objects   Most MCM sonars are hull mounted but a few types are VDS design   An example of a hull mounted MCM sonar is the   Type 2193   while the   SQQ 32 Mine hunting sonar   and   Type 2093   systems are VDS designs  See also   Minesweeper  ship    \n  \n     Submarine navigation     \n   Main Submarine navigation   \n  \n Submarines rely on sonar to a greater extent than surface ships as they cannot use radar at depth   The sonar arrays may be hull mounted or towed   Information fitted on typical fits is given in   Oyashio class submarine   and   Swiftsure class   submarine  \n  \n     Aircraft     \n  \n Helicopters can be used for antisubmarine warfare by deploying fields of active passive sonobuoys or can operate dipping

Dipping Sonar Dipping Sonar   can be on the aircraft or on ship   Dipping sonar has the advantage of being deployable to depths appropriate to daily conditions Helicopters have also been used for mine

oceans  collectively called   SOSUS Sound Surveillance System  SOSUS    and later Integrated Undersea Surveillance System  IUSS   A similar system is believed to have been operated by the Soviet Union   As permanently mounted arrays in the deep ocean were utilised  they were in very quiet conditions so long ranges could be achieved   Signal processing was carried out using powerful computers ashore   With the ending of the Cold War a SOSUS array has been turned over to scientific use  \n  \n In the United States Navy  a special badge known as the   Integrated Undersea Surveillance System Badge

active sonars   An example of this is the Type 2082 fitted on the British   Vanguard class submarine  s  \n  \n    Civilian applications    \n  \n     Fisheries     \n  \n   Fishing   is an important industry that is seeing growing demand  but world catch tonnage is falling as a result of serious resource problems  The industry faces a future of continuing worldwide consolidation until a point of   sustainability   can be reached  However  the consolidation of the fishing fleets are driving increased demands for sophisticated fish finding electronics such as sensors  sounders and sonars   Historically  fishermen have used many different techniques to find and harvest fish  However  acoustic technology has been one of the most important driving forces behind the development of the modern commercial fisheries  \n  \n Sound waves travel differently through fish than through water because a fish \' s air filled   swim bladder   has a different density than seawater  This density difference allows the detection of schools of fish by using reflected sound  Acoustic technology is especially well suited for underwater applications since sound travels farther and faster underwater than in air  Today  commercial fishing vessels rely almost completely on acoustic sonar and sounders to detect fish  Fishermen also use active sonar and echo sounder technology to determine water depth  bottom contour  and bottom composition  \n   Image Fishfinder jpg thumb right Cabin display of a fish finder sonar   \n  \n Companies such as eSonar  Raymarine UK  Marport Canada  Wesmar  Furuno  Krupp  and Simrad make a variety of sonar and acoustic instruments for the   deep sea   commercial fishing industry  For example  net sensors take various underwater measurements and transmit the information back to a receiver on board a vessel  Each sensor is equipped with one or more acoustic transducers depending on its specific function  Data is transmitted from the sensors using wireless acoustic telemetry and is received by a hull mounted hydrophone  The   analog signal  s are decoded and converted by a digital acoustic receiver into data which is transmitted to a bridge computer for   graphical display   on a high resolution monitor  \n  \n    Echo sounding    \n   main Echo sounding   \n Echo sounding is a process used to determine the depth of water beneath   ship  s and   boat  s  A type of active sonar  echo sounding is the transmission of an acoustic pulse directly downwards to the seabed  measuring the time between transmission and echo return  after having hit the bottom and bouncing back to its ship of origin  The acoustic pulse is emitted by a transducer which receives the return echo as well  The depth measurement is calculated by multiplying the speed of sound in water averaging 1 500 meters per second  by the time between emission and echo return  lt ref gt http   www jrank org encyclopedia pages cm7l33fj1o Fathometer html lt  ref gt  lt ref

acoustic instruments that operate in a similar fashion to echo sounders but  because their function is slightly different from the initial model of the echo sounder  have been given different terms  \n  \n     Net location     \n  \n The net sounder is an echo sounder with a transducer mounted on the headline of the net rather than on the bottom of the vessel  Nevertheless  to accommodate the distance from the transducer to the display unit  which is much greater than in a normal echo sounder  several refinements have to be made  Two main types are available  The first is the cable type in which the signals are sent along a cable  In this case there has to be the provision of a cable drum on which to haul  shoot and stow the cable during the different phases of the operation  The second type is the cable less net sounder     such as Marport   s Trawl Explorer   in which the signals are sent acoustically between the net and hull mounted receiver hydrophone on the vessel  In this case no cable drum is required but sophisticated electronics are needed at the transducer and receiver  \n  \n The display on a net sounder shows the distance of the net from the bottom  or the surface   rather than the depth of water as with the echo sounder \' s hull mounted   transducer    Fixed to the headline of the net  the footrope can usually be seen which gives an indication of the net performance  Any fish passing into the net can also be seen  allowing fine adjustments to be made to catch the most fish possible  In other fisheries  where the amount of fish in the net is important  catch sensor transducers are mounted at various positions on the cod end of the net  As the cod end fills up these catch sensor transducers are triggered one by one and this information is transmitted acoustically to display monitors on the bridge of the vessel  The skipper can then decide when to haul the net  \n  \n Modern versions of the net sounder  using multiple element transducers  function more like a sonar than an echo sounder and show slices of the area in front of the net and not merely the vertical view that the initial net sounders used  \n  \n The sonar is an echo sounder with a directional capability that can show fish or other objects around the vessel  \n  \n     ROV and UUV     \n  \n Small sonars have been fitted to Remotely Operated Vehicles  ROV  and Unmanned Underwater Vehicles  UUV  to allow their operation in murky conditions   These sonars are used for looking ahead of the vehicle   The   Long Term Mine Reconnaissance System   is an UUV for MCM
