topic of jealousy in their works  \n  \n Jealousy is the powerful complex of emotions experienced at the loss  real or imagined  of something or someone you believe is yours  whereas envy concerns what you don   t have and would like to possess  Othello is filled with jealousy at the thought of losing Desdemona  Iago is consumed with envy of Othello   s prestige  Because jealous lovers tell multiple stories about those who arouse their jealousy  and because the emotion is so corrosive  jealousy is a common theme in literature and art  not to mention opera and cinema  \n  \n   Literature   \n Literary works use a variety of devices to explore its possibilities and reveal its wider implications  Most famously  perhaps  Schahriar \' s destructive jealousy in  \'  \'   One Thousand and One Nights   \'  \'  is what precipitates Scheherazade   s creative outpouring of stories  In   Ariosto     s  \'  \'   Orlando furioso   \'  \'   1516  jealousy leads to such a distortion of the world that the sufferer is driven to madness    Shakespeare   \' s later play   \'  \' the Winters tale \'  \'   1613  is predominately about the jealousy felt by Leontes \'  and his supposed adulterous wife    E  T  A  Hoffmann     s Princess Brambilla  1821  is more concerned with the interplay between jealousy and the theater  between reality and masks  In   Charlotte Bront       s  \'  \' Villette \'  \'   1853  jealousy becomes a game of reflections and speculations  a potent denial of sexual stereotypes  and  like many novels written by women  an angry rejection of the violation of the individual caused by the gaze of the jealous lover    Anthony Trollope   uses both  \'  \' He Knew He Was Right \'  \'   1869  and  \'  \' Kept in the Dark \'  \'   1882  to analyze not only double standards used to judge how men and women behave but also the relationship between mind and body    Tolstoy     s  \'  \'   The Kreutzer Sonata   \'  \'   1889  offers a compelling exploration of jealousy acting as a front for repressed   homosexuality      Proust     s  \'  \' In Search of Lost Time \'  \'   1913   1927   especially the section concerning Albertine  represents the claustrophobic nature of the passion of jealousy through the tropes of imprisonment  illness and death  while   Michal Choromanski     s  \'  \' Jealousy and Medicine \'  \'   1932  creates a landscape and a climate that recreate to the full the physical experience of jealousy    Freud     s reading of jealousy and his emphasis on repetitive structures inspires   Iris Murdoch     s  \'  \' A Word Child \'  \'   1975  in which the   London   subway symbolizes endless repetition of the same  \n  \n Other novelists have used jealousy to explore the relationship between writer and reader  as well as that between fiction and reality    Alain Robbe Grillet     s  \'  \' Jealousy \'  \'   1965  develops the image of the window blind  in   French language French      la jalousie    means both the emotion and the window blind  to lock the reader into the jealous person   s mind  while in   Julian Barnes     s  \'  \' Talking it Over \'  \'   1991   the writer   s jealousy of the reader   s attention is as much a part of the story as the sexual jealousy it also examines    A  S  Byatt     s  \'  \' Possession \'  \'   1990  is in part an analysis of the ways in which writing and reading operate to silence other voices  \n  \n   Graphic arts   \n   File On the Beach    Two Are Company  Three Are None jpg thumb right 300px  \'  \' Two are Company  Three Are None \'  \'   1872  a   wood engraving   by   Winslow Homer     \n In art  depicting a face reflecting the ravages of jealousy was a frequent studio exercise  see for instance drawings by   Charles Le Brun    1619   1690  or   S  bastien Leclerc  1676 1763  S  bastien Leclerc    the Younger   1676   1763   or in a fuller treatment  the howling figure on the left in   Bronzino     s  \'  \' An Allegory with Venus and Cupid \'  \'   probably 1540 50     Albrecht D  rer     s 1498 drawing   \'  \' Hercules   s Jealousy \'  \'  depicts jealousy as a powerfully built woman armed with a sword  The theme of jealousy is frequently conveyed through images of the gaze as in   Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres     s  \'  \' Paolo and Francesca \'  \'   1819  which reveals the jealous husband   s gaze catching the young lovers    first kiss    Edvard Munch     s many depictions of jealousy  however  tend to place the husband at the front of the painting with a couple behind him as if to suggest that jealousy is created more by the mind than by the gaze  This suggestion is intensified by his cunning use of symbolic colors  There are  nevertheless  lighter moments  as when   Gaston de La Touche    1854   1913   in  \'  \' Jealousy or the Monkey \'  \'  shows a love scene interrupted by a monkey tugging on the woman   s dress  While popular images of jealousy tend to the lurid  it remains a source  both in literature and in painting  of highly creative artistic strategies that have little to do with the negative and destructive sides of the emotion itself  \n  \n   See also   \n   colbegin  16em   \n

can be noted between high culture and   Tradition traditional     folklore folk culture   as they can be all conceived as the repository of shared and accumulated traditions functioning as a living continuum between the past and present  \n  \n   Concept   \n Although it has a longer history in Continental Europe  the term was introduced into English largely with the publication in 1869 of  \'  \'   Culture and Anarchy   \'  \'  by   Matthew Arnold    although he most often uses just  quot culture quot   Arnold defined   culture   as  quot the disinterested endeavour after man \' s perfection quot   Preface  and most famously wrote that having culture meant to  quot know the best that has been said and thought in the world quot    a specifically literary definition  also embracing   Philosophy    which is now rather less likely to be considered an essential component of High Culture  at least in the English speaking cultures  Arnold saw high culture as a force for moral and political good  and in various forms this view remains widespread  though far from uncontested  The term is contrasted with   popular culture   or   mass culture   and also with folk culture  but by no means implies hostility to these  \n  \n   T  S  Eliot   \' s  \'  \' Notes Towards the Definition of Culture \'  \'   1948  was an influential work which saw high culture and popular culture as necessary parts of a complete culture   \'  \'   The Uses of Literacy   \'  \'  by   Richard Hoggart    1957  was an influential work along somewhat the same lines  concerned with the cultural experience of those  like himself  who had come from a working class background before university  In America    Harold Bloom   has taken a more exclusive line in a number of works  as did   F  R  Leavis   earlier   both  like Arnold  being mainly concerned with literature  and unafraid to champion vociferously the literature of the   Western canon    \n  \n In both the Western and some East Asian traditions  art that demonstrates the imagination of the artist has been accorded the highest status   In the West this tradition goes back to the Ancient Greeks  and was reinforced in the   Renaissance   and by   Romanticism    although the latter also did away with the   hierarchy of genres   within the   fine arts   established in the Renaissance   In China there was a distinction between the amateur   literati painting   of the   scholar official  s and the work produced by professional artists  working in largely different styles  or the decorative arts such as   Chinese porcelain   which were produced by unknown craftsmen working in large factories   In both China and the West the distinction was especially clear in   landscape painting    where for centuries imaginary views  produced from the imagination of the artist  were considered superior to works reproducing an actual view  \n  \n In the Western tradition high culture has historical origins in the intellectual and aesthetic ideals of   ancient Greece   and   ancient Rome Rome    Within this classical ideal certain authors and their modes of language were held up as models of an elevated style and good form as for instance the Attic dialect of ancient Greek associated with the great philosophers and dramatists of Periclean Athens  or Ciceronian Latin  Later  especially during the   Renaissance    these values were deeply imbibed by the cultural upper classes  and  as evinced in works like  \'  \' The Courtier \'  \'  by Baldasare Castiglione  knowledge of the classics became part of the aristocratic ideal  Over time  the refined classicism of the Renaissance was expanded to embrace a broader canon of authors in the modern languages that included figures such as Shakespeare  Goethe  and Cervantes   \n  \n For centuries an immersion in high culture was deemed an essential part of the proper education of the   gentleman    and this ideal was transmitted through high status schools and institutions throughout Europe and the United States   As it has evolved  Western notions of high culture have been associated at various times with  The study of  quot humane

many proponents of the concept devoted great efforts to promoting high culture among a wider public than the highly educated   bourgeoisie   whose natural territory it was supposed to be   There was a drive  beginning in the 19th century  to open   museum  s and   concert hall  s to give the general public access to high culture   Figures such as   John Ruskin   and   John Reith  1st Baron Reith Lord Reith   of the BBC in Britain    Leon Trotsky   and others in Communist   Russia    and many others in America and throughout the western world have worked to widen the appeal of elements of high culture such as   Classical music    Art by   old master  s and the   classic literature literary classics    \n  \n With the widening of access to university education  the effort spread there  and all aspects of high culture became the objects of academic study  which with the exception of the   Classical studies classics   had not often been the case until the late 19th century   University   liberal arts   courses still play an important role in the promotion of the concept of high culture  though often now avoiding the term itself  \n  \n Especially in Europe  governments have been prepared to subsidize high culture through the funding of   museum  s    opera   and   ballet   companies    orchestra  s  cinema  public   broadcasting   stations such as   BBC Radio 3      ARTE   and in other ways   Organisations such as the   Arts Council   in Britain  and in most European countries  whole ministries administer these programmes   This includes the subsidy of new works by composers  writers and artists   There are also many private philanthropic sources of funding  which are especially important in the US  where the federally funded   Corporation for Public Broadcasting   also funds broadcasting  These may be seen as part of the broader concept of   official culture    although often a mass audience is not the intended market  \n  \n   Theoreticians   \n High culture and its relation to mass culture have been  in different ways  a central concern of much theoretical work in   cultural studies      critical theory      media studies   and   sociology

' \n Often community art is based in economically deprived areas  with a community oriented  grassroots approach  Members of a local community will come together to express concerns or issues through an artistic process  sometimes this may involve professional artists or actors  These communal artistic processes act as a catalyst to trigger events or changes within a community or even at a national or international level  \n  \n In English speaking countries  community art is often seen as the work of community   arts centre      Visual arts      fine art    video    new media art     music  and theater are common mediums in community art centers  Many arts companies in the UK do some community based work  which typically involves developing participation by non professional members of local communities  \n  \n    Community art and public art    \n The term  quot community art quot  refers also to field of community  neighbourhood and public art practice with roots in social justice and popular and informal education methods  In the art world  community art signifies a particular art making practice  emphasizing community involvement and collaboration  Community art is most often art for social change and involves some empowerment of the community members who come together to create artwork s with artists  This is a growing national  international  regional and local field  Recently community arts and sustainability work or environmental action have begun to interface  including urban revitalization projects creating artwork at a neighbourhood level  \n  \n    Online community art    \n A   community   can be seen in many ways  it can refer to different kind of groups  There are also   virtual communities   or online communities     Internet art   has many different forms  but often there is some kind of community that is created for a project or it is an effect of an art project  \n  \n   Community theatre   \n   Community theatre   includes theatre made by  with  and for a community   it may refer to theatre that is made almost by a community with no outside help  or to a collaboration between community members and professional theatre artists  or to performance made entirely by professionals that is addressed to a particular community  Community theatres range in size from small groups led by single individuals that perform in borrowed spaces to large permanent companies with well equipped facilities of their own  Many community theatres are successful  non profit businesses with a large active membership and  often  a full time professional staff  Community theatre is often   devised theatre devised   and may draw on popular theatrical forms  such as   carnival      circus    and   parade  s  as well as performance modes from commercial theatre  Community theatre is understood to contribute to the   social capital   of a community  insofar as it develops the skills  community spirit  and artistic sensibilities

'In the   visual arts    a  \'  \'  \' theme \'  \'  \'  is a broad idea or a message conveyed by a work  such as a performance  a painting  or a motion picture  This message is usually about   life      society   or   human nature    Themes are the fundamental and often universal ideas explored in a work  Themes are usually implied rather than explicitly stated  Deep thematic content is not required in a visual work  however  some observers would say that all visual work inherently projects some kind of outlook on life that can be taken as a theme  regardless of whether or not this is the   Authorial intentionality intent of the author    Analysis of changes  or implied change  in dynamic characteristics of the work can provide insight into a particular theme  \n  \n A theme is not the same as the subject of a work  For example  the  \'  \' subject \'  \'  of  \'  \'   Star Wars   \'  \'  is  quot the battle for control of the galaxy between the   Galactic Empire  Star Wars  Galactic Empire   and the   Rebel Alliance   quot   The  \'  \' themes \'  \'  explored in the films might be  quot moral ambiguity quot  or  quot the conflict between technology and nature quot   \n  \n Themes differ from   motif  visual arts  motifs   in that themes are ideas conveyed by the visual experience as a whole  while motifs are repeated symbols found inside an overarching theme  Simply having repeated symbolism related to chess  does not make the story \' s theme the similarity of life to chess  Themes arise from the interplay of the plot  the characters  and the attitude the author takes to them  and the same story can be given very different themes in the hands of different authors    \n  \n While thematic analysis is a primary concern of   Art critic  s  a minority viewpoint holds that explicitly stating the theme of a work universalizes it in an inappropriate way   For example  many love stories end happily when the hero and heroine marry  thus the theme  quot Marriage equals happiness  quot   Critics would point out that marriage rarely does simply equate to happiness and that marriage and happiness are individual and cultural intangibles that may or may not relate  \n  \n The term  \'  \'  \' theme \'  \'  \'  may be used in the same way to refer to works of   Theme  literature  literature    The examples below are not necessarily the only themes in the works listed  \n  \n   See also   \n    Motif  visual arts    \n    Film criticism   \n    Art criticism   \n  \n   DEFAULTSORT Theme  Arts    \n ',0

narrative license \'  \'  \'    \'  \'  \' licentia poetica \'  \'  \'   or simply  \'  \'  \' license \'  \'  \'   is a colloquial term  sometimes   euphemism    used to denote the distortion of fact  alteration of the conventions of grammar or language  or rewording of pre existing text made by an   artist   to improve a piece of   art    \n  \n   Examples   \n The artistic license may also refer to the ability of an artist to apply smaller distortions  such as a poet ignoring some of the minor requirements of   grammar   for poetic effect  lt ref gt Harvey  Thomas Wadleigh  2008    \'  \' A Practical Grammar of the English Language  \'  \'  BiblioBazaar  LLC  p  263  lt  ref gt  For example    Mark Antony   \' s  quot Friends  Romans  Countrymen  lend me your ears quot  from   Shakespeare   \' s  \'  \'   Julius Caesar  play  Julius Caesar   \'  \'  would technically require the word  quot and quot  before  quot countrymen quot   but the conjunction  quot and quot  is omitted to preserve the rhythm of   iambic pentameter    the resulting conjunction is called an   Asyndeton asyndetic     tricolon     Conversely  on the next line  the end of  quot I come to bury Caesar  not to praise him quot  has an extra syllable because omitting the word  quot him quot  would make the sentence unclear  but adding a syllable at the end would not disrupt the meter  lt ref gt Herzberg  Max John  1933    \'  \' Off to Arcady  adventures in poetry  \'  \'  American book co  p  35  lt  ref gt  Both of these are examples of artistic license   \n  \n Another example of artistic license is the way in which stylized images of an object  for instance in a   stylized painting painting   or an   stylized animation animated movie    are different from their real life counterparts  but are still intended to be interpreted by the viewer as representing the same thing  This can mean the omission of details  or the simplification of shapes and colour shades  even to the point that the image is nothing more than a   pictogram    It can also mean the addition of non existing details  or exaggeration of shapes and colours  as in   fantasy art   or a   caricature    \n  \n Certain stylizations have become fixed conventions in art  an agreement between artist and viewer that is understood and undebated  A striking example is how in simple cartoon drawings monochromatic white parts on a dark coloured surface are immediately recognized by most viewers to represent the reflection of light on a smooth or wet surface  \n  \n In summary  artistic license is  \n   Entirely at

 and other   police procedural   programs typically omit completely the more mundane aspects of the occupation such as paperwork  reports  administrative duties and other daily  quot business oriented quot  aspects which in reality often constitute the majority of police work  They will also present other duties with much more action  suspense or drama than would be experienced in reality  The same is also true for many military oriented adventure stories which often show high ranking characters being allowed to continuously enter dangerous situations when in reality  they would usually be restricted to command oriented or administrative duties  \n  \n   Controversy and criticism   \n Artistic license often provokes   controversy   by offending those who resent the reinterpretation of cherished beliefs or previous works  lt ref gt Toplin  Robert Brent  2002   \'  \' Reel history  in defense of Hollywood  \'  \'  University Press of Kansas  p  1  lt  ref gt  Artists often respond to these criticisms by pointing out that their work was not intended to be a   wikt verbatim verbatim   portrayal of something previous and should be judged only on   artistic merit    Artistic license is a generally accepted practice  particularly when the result is widely acclaimed    William Shakespeare   \' s historical plays  for example  are gross distortions of historical fact but are nevertheless lauded as outstanding literary works  lt ref gt Barroll  J  Leeds  1975    \'  \' Shakespeare Studies  An Annual Gathering of Research  Criticism  Reviews  \'  \'  Ayer Publishing  p  306  lt  ref gt  \n  \n Critical voices are sometimes raised when artistic license is applied to cinematic and other depictions of real historical events  While slight manipulation for dramatic effect of chronology and character traits are generally accepted  some critics feel that depictions that present a significantly altered reality are irresponsible  particularly because many viewers and readers do not know the actual events and may thus take the dramatized depiction to be true to reality  Examples of films and television series criticized for excessive use of dramatic license include Disney

'  For a broader  also standard  usage of a term below Cultural economics   \n  \'  \'  \' Economics of the arts and literature \'  \'  \'   or  \'  \'  \' cultural economics \'  \'  \'   used below for convenience  is a branch of economics that studies the economics of creation  distribution  and the consumption of   work of art works of art   and literature    For a long time the arts were confined to visual and performing arts in the Anglo Saxon tradition  Usage has widened since the beginning of the 1980s with the study of   cultural industry    cinema and music publishing   and the economy of cultural institutions  museums  libraries  historic buildings    The field is coded as   JEL classification codes Other special topics  economics  JEL  Z Subcategories JEL  Z11   in the  \'

concerned with arts in a broad sense  The goods considered have creative content  but that is not enough to qualify as a cultural good  Designer goods are not considered to be works of art or culture  Cultural goods are those with a value determined by symbolic content rather than physical characteristics   For further considerations  see also   Cultural Institutions Studies     \n  \n Economic thinking has been applied in ever more areas in the last decennia  including pollution  \n corruption and education  Works of art and culture have a specific quality  which is their uniqueness  \n There just aren \' t two   Nighthawks  es  \n  \n As there is no equivalent item for each  classical economist   Adam Smith   held it was impossible to \n value them    Alfred Marshall   noted that the demand for a certain kind of cultural good can depend on its consumption  The more you have listened to a particular kind of music  the more you appreciate  In his \n economic framework  these goods do not have the usual decreasing   marginal utility    \n Key works in the cultural economics as such were those of   William Baumol Baumol   and   William G  Bowen Bowen    Performing Arts  The Economic Dilemma  1966   of   Gary Becker   on addictive goods  and of   Alan Peacock    Public Choice   \n  \n This summary has been divided into sections on the economic study of the performing arts  on the market of individual pieces of art  the art market in cultural industries  the economics of cultural heritage and the labour market in the art sector  \n  \n    Performing arts  Baumol and cultural economics    \n The seminal paper by William Baumol and Bowen introduced the term   Baumol \' s cost disease cost disease   for a relative cost growth of live performances  This cost growth explains the increasing dependency of this kind of art on state subsidies  It occurs when the consumable good is labour itself  To understand this phenomenon  compare the change in the cost of performing the   Moli  re   play  quot   Tartuffe   quot  in 1664 and in 2007 with the change in cost of calculating a large number of sums from an accounting ledger  In 1664  you needed two hours and twelve actors to perform Moli  re \' s play  and it would take  say  twelve accountants working for two hours to add up all the sums in an accounting ledger  In 2007  a single accountant with a  10 calculator can add the sums in 20 minutes  but you still need two hours and twelve actors for the Moli  re play   \n  \n Now  the artist trade needs a considerable investment in   human capital    and needs to be paid accordingly  The artists \'  pay need to rise along with that of the population in general  As the latter is following the general productivity in the economy  the cost of a play will rise with general productivity  while the actors \'  productivity does not rise   \n  \n There are two lines of thought in subsequent literature on the economics of the performing arts   \n  \n  The first concentrates on the existence of productivity growth in some areas of production  thus contradicting the relevance of cost disease  Staying with the  quot Tartuffe quot  example  the same performance can be viewed by an ever larger audience by improvements in the design of theatres  and by the introduction of microphones  television and recording  \n  The second is concerned with the allocation of subsidies to the cultural sector  While these should be in the general public interest  they may have an income distribution effect  e g  if they reduce cost to the relatively well off part of society  This is the case when the well off are overrepresented in the audiences of subsidized plays  or when subsidies go to a small elitist group of artists  \n  \n    The market for artworks    \n Two segments of the market in the visual arts can be distinguished  works of art that are familiar and have a history  and contemporary works that are more easily influenced by fashion and new discoveries  Both markets  however  are   oligopoly oligopolistic    i e   there are limited numbers of sellers and buyers    oligopsony     \n Two central questions on the working of the markets are  How are prices determined  and what is the   rate of return return   on artworks  compared to the return on financial assets   \n  \n     Price determination     \n Components of a work of art  like stone or paint  in general have a value much lower than the finished product  Also  the amount of labour needed to produce an item does not explain the big price differences between works of art  It seems that the value is much more dependent on potential buyers \'   and experts \'  perception of it  This perception has three elements  First  social value  which is the social status the buyer has by owning it  The artist thus has an  quot artistic capital quot   Second  the artistic value  compared to contemporary works  or as importance to later generations  Third  the price history of the item  if a buyer uses this for his expectation of a future price at which he might sell the item again  given the oligopolistic market structure   \n Three kinds of economic agents determine these values  Specific experts like gallery owners or museum directors  the first  Experts like art historians  the second  Buyers who buy works of art as an investment  the third  \n  \n     Art market and investment     \n Some major financial institutions  banks and insurance companies  have had considerable return rates on investments in art works in the 1990s  These rates haven \' t slowed down at the same time as the rates on   stock exchange  s  in the early 90 \' s  This may indicate a   diversification  finance  diversification   opportunity  Apart from this evidence of successful investment  the amount of data available has stimulated study of the market  Many works are sold on   auction  s  These transactions are thus very transparent  This has made it possible to establish price databases  with prices of some items going back to 1652  \n  \n Empirical studies have shown that  on average  the   rate of return return   on works of art has been lower than that on   stock equity    with a   Volatility  finance  volatility   that is at least as high  An   intangible asset intangible   gain in terms of pleasure of having a work of art could explain this partly  However  before interpreting the figures  it should be borne in mind that art is often exempt of many kinds of taxes   \n  \n In 1986  Baumol made an estimate of an average yearly rate of return of 0 55 percent for works of art  against a rate of return of 2 5 percent for financial assets  over a 20 year period  \n  \n    Cultural industries    \n Some artwork is not reproducible  but there are many cultural goods whose value does not depend on the individual copy  Books  recordings  movies get some of their value from the existence of many copies of the original  These are the products of cultural industries  These markets are characterized by  \n   Uncertainty on value  The demand for a good  success  is hard to predict  This is a characteristic of an   experience good    \n   Infinite variety  You can differentiate between products  e g  a car  on basis of its characteristics  Many products allow classification on a relatively small number of such characteristics  Cultural goods  however  have a very high number of them  which  on top of that  often are subjective  This makes them hard to compare  \n   High concentration in traded products  A major part of sales is in best sellers or block busters  \n   Short   product life cycle management life cycle    Most items are sold shortly after introduction  \n   High   fixed cost    There is high cost before introduction  Making a movie is much more expensive than producing another copy  \n  \n     Market structure     \n The important cultural industries have an   oligopolistic     market structure    The market is dominated by a few major companies  the rest of the market consisting of a big number of small companies  The latter may act as a filter for the artistic supply  A small company with a successful artist can be bought by one of the majors  \n Big conglomerates  pooling TV and film production  have existed since the 1920s  The 1990s have seen some mergers extending beyond the industry as such  and mergers of hardware producers with content providers  Anticipated gains from   synergy   and   market power   have not been realised  and from the early 2000s there has been a trend towards organisation along sector lines  \n  \n    Economics of cultural heritage    \n   Cultural heritage   is reflected in goods and real estate  Management and   regulatory economics regulation   of museums has come under study in this area  \n  \n     Museums     \n Museums  which have a conservatory role  and provide exhibitions to the general public  can be commercial  or on a non profit base  In the second case  as they provide a   public good    they pose the problems related to these goods  should they be self financing  or be subsidized   One of the specific issues is the imbalance between the huge value of the collections in museums  and their budgets  Also  they are often located in places  city centres  where the cost of land is high  which limits their expansion possibilities  American museums exhibit only about half of their collection  Some museums in Europe  like the Pompidou Centre in France  show less than 5 percent of their collection  Apart from providing exhibitions  museums get proceeds from derived products  like catalogues and reproductions  They also produce at a more intangible level  They make collections  Out of so many pieces in the public domain  they make a selection based on their expertise  thus adding value to the mere existence of the items  \n  \n The dual goal of conservation and providing exhibitions obviously presents a choice  On the one hand the museum has  for conservation reasons  an interest in exhibiting as few items as possible  and it would select lesser known works and a specialized audience  to promote knowledge and research  On the other hand  the exhibition argument requires showing the major pieces from different cultures  to satisfy the demands from the public and to attract a large audience  When a government has made a choice about this  application of economic   contract theory   will help to implement this choice by showing how to use incentives to different managers  on the financial  conservatory side  to obtain the required result  \n  \n     Real estate     \n Many countries have systems that protect buildings and structures they consider to be of cultural interest  Owners get tax deductions or subsidies for restoration  in return for which they accept restrictions on modifications to the buildings or provide public access  Such a system poses the same choice problems as museums do  There has been little study of this issue  \n  \n    The artists \'  labour market    \n The labour market for artists is characterized by four things in particular  \n   There is an extremely unequal   income distribution   within the market segment  A very small group of people earn a high proportion of the total income  \n   There is a structural excess supply of labour  There are always more people who like to earn their income as an artist than there is demand for them  \n   There are intangible returns to labour  so that people accept lower wages than their qualifications would earn in a different market  \n   Non separation of artist and work  The image their product gives them  is important  to artists  \n  \n     The star system     \n The term   superstar  celebrity   quot star system quot     coined by   Sherwin Rosen S  Rosen    is used for the phenomenon that a handful of the artists in the market  earn a major part of total earnings in a sector  Rosen \' s 1981 paper examined the economics of superstars to determine why    relatively small numbers of people earn enormous amounts of money and seem to dominate the fields in which they engage     Rosen argues that in superstar markets   quot small differences in talent at the top of the distribution will translate into large differences in revenue  quot  Rosen points out that  quot    sellers of higher talent charge only slightly higher prices than those of lower talent  but sell much larger quantities  their greater earnings come overwhelmingly from selling larger quantities than from charging higher prices quot  \n  \n In cultural industries  the uncertainty about the quality of a product plays a role in this  The consumer does not really know how good the product is  until he has consumed it  think of a movie   and the producer is confronted with the typical uncertainty in a cultural industry  The consumer looks for guidance in the price  reputation  or a famous name on the cover or poster  As the producer understands this affects demand  he is prepared to pay a lot for a name considered a sign of quality  a star   Indeed  authors like Adler and Ginsburgh have given evidence that star status is determined by chance  in a musical contest  results were highly correlated with the order of performance c \n  \n This randomness has been used to explain why the labor supply in the sector remains excessive  given extreme gains of a star  and an irrational behaviour  or particular preferences  with respect to chance  unsuccessful artists keep trying  even when they are earning their money mostly in a different trade  A second argument is the possibility of intangible returns to artists \'  labour in terms of social status  \n  \n     Production structure     \n A case has been made for the existence of a different structure in the production of cultural goods    See   Cultural Institutions Studies     An artist often considers a product to be an expression of himself  while the ordinary craftsman is only concerned with his product  as far as it has an impact on his pay or salary  The artist may thus want restrict the use of his product

printing    normally on   paper    Except in the case of   monotyping    the process is capable of producing multiples of the same piece  which is called a print  Each print is considered an original  as opposed to a copy  The reasoning behind this is that the print is not a reproduction of another   work of art   in a different medium     for instance a painting     but rather an image designed from inception as a print  An individual print is also referred to as an impression  Prints are created from a single original surface  known technically as a   Matrix  printing  matrix    Common

'  \'  \' This article is concerned with cultural resources in the widest sense  for traditional  archaeological and historic culture specifically  see   cultural heritage management   \'  \'  \n  \n In the broadest sense   \'  \'  \' Cultural Resources Management  CRM  \'  \'  \'  is the vocation and practice of managing cultural resources  such as   the arts   and   cultural heritage heritage    It incorporates Cultural Heritage Management which is concerned with traditional and historic culture  It also delves into the material culture of   archaeology     Cultural resources management encompasses current culture  including progressive and innovative culture  such as   urban culture    rather than simply preserving and presenting traditional forms of culture  \n  \n However  the broad usage of the term is relatively recent and as a result it is most often used as synonymous with   heritage management    In the United States  cultural resources management is not usually divorced from the heritage context  The term is   quot used mostly by archaeologists and much more occasionally by architectural historians and historical architects  to refer to managing historic places of archaeological  architectural  and historical interests and considering such places in compliance with environmental and historic preservation laws  quot   lt ref gt King 1998  p  6 lt  ref gt  \n  \n Cultural resources include both physical assets such as archaeology    architecture      painting  s and   sculpture  s and also   intangible culture   such as   folklore   and interpretative arts  such as   storytelling   and   drama    lt ref gt  http   www culture gov uk Reference library Research det glossary abbreviations htm UK definition of cultural sector  lt  ref gt   Cultural resource managers are typically in charge of   museum  s    art museum galleries      theatre  s etc   especially those that emphasize culture specific to the local region or ethnic group     Cultural tourism   is a significant sector of the tourism industry  \n  \n At a national and international level  cultural resource management may be concerned with larger themes  such as   language  s in danger of extinction    public education    the ethos or operation of   multiculturalism    and promoting access to cultural resources   The   Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity   is an attempt by the   United Nations   to identify exemplars of intangible culture  \n  \n   Background Information   \n Cultural resource management can trace its beginning to the environment conservational movement in the 1960s and 1970s  lt ref gt Kerber 1994  p  2 lt  ref gt  During this time  there was growth in legislation concerning the protection of cultural resources  The Archaeological and Historic Preservation Act of 1974  commonly known as the Moss Bennett Act  helped to fuel the creation of CRM  while creating    growth in archaeological jobs in the federal government  academia  and private sector      lt ref gt Kerber 1994  p  2 lt  ref gt  Federal legislation had passed earlier in 1906 under the   Antiquities Act    but it was not until the 1970s when the term    cultural resources    was coined by the National Park Services  This term came into more popular usage after two meetings in 1974  the Cultural Resource Management conference and the Airlie House conference  lt ref gt Kerber 1994  p  2 lt  ref gt  Following these conferences  the National Park Service  NPS  defined cultural resources in the Cultural Resource Management Guidelines as being  \n  \n    Those tangible and intangible aspects of cultural systems  both living and dead  that are valued by or representative of a given culture or that contain information about a culture    They  include but are not limited to sites  structures  districts  objects  and historic documents associated with or representative of peoples  cultures  and human activities and events  either in the present or in the past  Cultural resources also can include primary written and verbal data for interpretation and understanding of those tangible resources      lt ref gt Kerber 1994  p  2 lt  ref gt  \n  \n   Cultural resources management applied to heritage management   \n   \'  \' Main article   Cultural Heritage Management   \'  \'  \n  \'  \'  \' Cultural resources management \'  \'  \'  in the heritage context is mainly concerned with the investigation of sites with archaeological potential  the preservation and interpretation of historic sites and artifacts  and the culture of indigenous people   The subject developed from initiatives in   rescue archaeology    sensitivities to the treatment of indigenous people  and subsequent legislation to protect cultural heritage  \n  \n In the 1970s  archaeologists created the term  quot cultural resource management quot  as a parallel to natural resource management to address the following resources  lt ref gt King 1998  pp  5  6 lt  ref gt  \n   Historic properties  as listed or eligible for the   National Register of Historic Places    \n   Older properties that may have cultural value  but may or may not be eligible for the National Register \n   Historic properties that have cultural value beyond their historicity \n   Native American graves and cultural items \n   Shipwrecks \n   Museum collections \n   Historical documents \n   Religious sites \n   Religious practices \n   Cultural use of natural resources \n   Folklife  tradition  and other social institutions \n   Theater groups  orchestras  and other community cultural amenities \n  \n A significant proportion of the archaeological investigation in countries that have heritage management legislation including the   USA   and   UK   is conducted on sites under threat of development  In the US  such investigations are now done by private companies on a consulting basis  lt ref gt  http   www unm edu  dap daddy daddy html  quot Who \' s my Daddy

http   www acra crm org Web site of the American Cultural Resources Association  lt  ref gt    Museum  s  besides being popular tourist attractions  often play roles in conservation of  and research on  threatened sites  including as repositories for collections from sites slated for destruction  \n  \n    National Register eligibility    \n In the United States  a common Cultural Resource Management task is the implementation of a Section 106 review  CRM archaeologists determine whether federally funded projects are likely to damage or destroy archaeological sites that may be eligible for the   National Register of Historic Places     This process commonly entails one or more   archaeological field survey  s  \n  \n   Careers in CRM   \n Cultural resource management features people from a wide array of disciplines  The general education of most involved in CRM includes  but is not limited to  sociology  archaeology  architectural history  cultural anthropology  social and cultural geography  and other fields in the social sciences  \n  \n In the field of cultural resource management there are many career choices  One could obtain a career with an action agency that works directly with the NEPA or even more specifically  Native American resources  lt ref gt King 1998  p  241 lt  ref gt  There are also careers that can be found in review agencies like the   Advisory Council on Historic Preservation   ACHP   or the   State Historic Preservation Office   SHPO  Beyond these choices  one could also obtain a career as part of the local government and work with planning agencies  housing agencies  social service agencies  local museums  libraries  or educational institutions  Jobs at private cultural resource management companies can range from field technicians  see   shovelbum    to principal investigators  project archaeologists  historic preservationists  and laboratory work   One could also become a part of an advocacy organization  such as the   National Trust for Historic Preservation    lt ref gt King 1998  pp  241  242 lt  ref gt  \n  \n   Debates   \n It is commonly debated in cultural resource management how to determine whether cultural or archaeological sites should be considered significant or not  The criteria that is stated by the National Register of Historic Places is said to be able to be    interpreted in different ways so that the significance    may be subjectively argued for many cultural resources      lt ref gt Kerber 1994  p  4 lt  ref gt  Another issue that arises among scholars is that    protection does not necessarily mean preservation      lt ref gt Kerber 1994  p  4 lt  ref gt  Any public projects occurring near the cultural resource can have adverse effects  Development plans for a proposed project may not be able to be changed to limit impact and to avoid damage to the resource  lt ref gt Kerber 1994  p  4 lt  ref gt  \n  \n   Management of cultural organizations   \n The vocation of management in cultural and creative sectors is the subject of research and improvement initiatives  by organizations such as  http   wwww aandb org uk Arts and Business  which take a partnership approach to involving professional business people in running and mentoring arts organizations   Some universities lt ref gt  http   www dkit ie display asp id 161 BA in Cultural Resources Management

 \n The management of cultural heritage is underpinned by academic research in   archaeology      ethnography   and   history     The broader subject is also underpinned by research in   sociology   and   culture studies    \n  \n   Cultural anthropology   \n   \'  \' Main article   Cultural anthropology   \'  \'  \n Understanding the traditional cultures of all peoples  Indigenous or not  is essential in mitigating the adverse impact of development and ensuring that intervention by more developed nations is not prejudicial to the interests of local people or results in the extinction of

cultural assets  lt ref gt  http   www culturalpolicies net  Compendium of Cultural Policies and Trends in Europe  lt  ref gt  \n  \n The exploitation of cultural resources can be controversial  particularly where the finite cultural heritage resources of developing countries are exported to satisfy the demand for antiquities market in the developed world   The exploitation of the potential intellectual property of traditional remedies in identifying candidates for new drugs has also been controversial   On the other hand  traditional crafts can be important elements of income from tourism  performance of traditional dances  and music that is popular with tourists and traditional designs can be exploited in the fashion industry   Popular culture can also be an important economic asset  \n  \n   See also   \n     Centre for Cultural Resources and Training   \n     Committee on Education  Culture  Tourism and Human Resources   \n     Community art   \n     Cultural anthropology

fresco \'  \'  is painted on nearly dry plaster  and was defined by the sixteenth century author Ignazio Pozzo as  quot firm enough not to take a thumb print quot  so that the pigment only penetrates slightly into the plaster  By the end of the sixteenth century this had largely displaced the  \'  \' buon fresco \'  \'  method  and was used by painters such as   Gianbattista Tiepolo   or

often be commissioned by a sponsor  Often it is the local government or a business  but many murals have been paid for with grants of   patronage    For artists  their work gets a wide audience who otherwise might not set foot in an art gallery   A city benefits by the beauty of a work of art  \n  \n Murals can be a relatively effective tool of social emancipation or achieving a political goal  Murals have sometimes been created against the law  or have been commissioned by local bars and coffeeshops  Often  the visual effects are an enticement to attract public attention to social issues  \n State sponsored public art expressions  particularly murals  are often used by   totalitarian   regimes as a tool of mass control and propaganda  However  despite the propagandist character of that works  some of them still have an artistic value  \n  \n Murals can have a dramatic impact whether consciously or subconsciously on the attitudes of passers by  when they are added to areas where people live and work  It can also be argued that the presence of large  public murals can add aesthetic improvement to the daily lives of residents or that of employees at a corporate venue  \n  \n

which became famous as the   Berlin Wall    While on the East Berlin side painting was not allowed  artists painted on the Western side of the Wall from the 80s until the fall of the Wall in 1989  \n  \n Many unknown but also known artists such as   Thierry Noir   and   Keith Haring   painted on the Wall  the    World \' s longest   canvas       The sometimes detailed artwork were often painted over within hours or days  On the Western side the Wall was not protected  so everybody could paint on the Wall  After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 the Eastern side of the Wall became also a popular    canvas    for many mural and   graffiti   artists  \n   Orgosolo    in   Sardinia    is a most important center of   murals     politics    \n  \n It is also common for mural graffiti be

Forestmural jpg thumb left Forest mural by  \'  \' One Red Shoe \'  \'  in private home  England 2007   \n Many people like to express their individuality by commissioning an artist to paint a mural in their home  this is not an activity exclusively for owners of large houses  A mural artist is only limited by the fee and therefore the time spent on the painting  dictating the level of detail  a simple mural can be added to the smallest of walls  \n  \n Private commissions can be for dining rooms  bathrooms  living rooms or  as is often the case  children \' s bedrooms  A child \' s room can be transformed into the  \' fantasy world \'  of a   forest   or   racing track    encouraging imaginative play and an awareness of art  \n  \n The current trend for feature walls has increased commissions for muralists in the UK  A large hand painted mural can be designed on a specific theme  incorporate personal images and elements and may be altered during the course of painting it  The personal interaction between client and muralist is often a unique experience for an individual not usually involved in the arts  \n  \n Public commissions of murals in schools  hospitals and retirement homes can achieve \n a pleasing and welcoming atmosphere in these caring institutions  \n  \n In the 1980s  illusionary wall painting experienced a renaissance in private homes  The reason for this revival in interior design could  in some cases be attributed to the reduction in living space for the individual  Faux architectural features as well as natural scenery and views can have the effect of  \' opening out \'  the walls  Densely built up areas of housing may also contribute to people \' s feelings of being cut off from nature in its free form  A mural commission of this sort may be an attempt by some people to re establish a balance with nature  \n  \n     Graffiti style interior murals     \n   Image Acehotel 002023 jpg thumb left Mint amp Serf at   Ace Hotel    New

landscape and onto walls of private and corporate clients  \n As graffiti street art became more main stream in the late 1990s  youth oriented brands such as Nike  Red Bull and Wieden Kennedy have

musicians  painters  and sculptors  It can also refer to the right of bestowing offices or   Benefice church benefices    the business given to a store by a regular customer  and the   patron saint guardianship of saints    The word  quot patron quot  derives from the   Latin    \'  \' patronus \'  \'    quot patron  quot  one who gives benefits to his clients  see   Patronage in ancient Rome     \n  \n In some countries the term is used to describe  \'  \'  \' political patronage \'  \'  \'   which is the use of state resources to reward individuals for their electoral support  Some patronage systems are legal  as in the Canadian tradition of the Prime Minister to appoint   Senate of Canada senators   and the heads of a number of commissions and agencies  in many cases  these appointments go to people who have supported the political party of the Prime Minister  As well  the term may refer to a type of   Political corruption corruption   or favoritism in which a party in power rewards groups  families  ethnicities for their electoral support using illegal gifts or fraudulently awarded appointments or government contracts  lt ref gt For a recent study of political

greatest detail in reference to   Middle Ages medieval   and   Renaissance   Europe  though patronage can also be traced in   History of Japan feudal Japan    the traditional   Southeast Asia  n kingdoms  and elsewhere   art patronage tended to arise wherever a   royal family royal   or   Empire imperial   system and an   aristocracy   dominated a society and controlled a significant share of resources    Samuel Johnson   defined a patron as  quot one who looks with unconcern on a man struggling for life in the water  and  when he has reached ground  encumbers him with help quot   lt ref gt Quoted in Michael Rosenthal   \'  \' Constable \'  \'   London  Thames and  Hudson  1987  p  203  lt  ref gt  \n  \n Rulers  nobles and very wealthy people used patronage of the arts to endorse their political ambitions  social positions  and prestige  That is  patrons operated as   sponsor  commercial  sponsor  s  Most languages other than English still use the term  \'  \' mecenate \'  \'   derived from the name of   Gaius Maecenas    generous friend and adviser to the   Roman Emperor     Augustus    Some patrons  such as the   Medici   of   Florence    used artistic patronage to  quot cleanse quot  wealth that was perceived as ill gotten through   usury    Art patronage was especially important in the creation of   religious art    The   Roman Catholic Church   and later   Protestantism Protestant   groups sponsored art and   architecture    as seen in   Church  building  churches      cathedral  s    painting      sculpture   and   handicraft  s  \n  \n While sponsorship of artists and the   commission  art  commissioning   of artwork is the best known aspect of the patronage system  other disciplines also benefited from patronage  including those who studied   natural philosophy      History of science pre modern     science       music  ians    literature writers      philosophy philosophers      alchemy alchemists      astrology astrologers

that European culture moved away from its patronage system to the more publicly supported system of museums  theaters  mass audiences and mass consumption that is familiar in the contemporary world      \n    \n This kind of system continues across many fields of the   arts    Though the nature of the sponsors has changed   from churches to charitable foundations  and from aristocrats to plutocrats   the term  \'  \' patronage \'  \'  has a more neutral   connotation   than in politics  It may simply refer to direct support  often financial  of an artist  for example by   Grant  money  grants

countries  such as those using the   Westminster system    this is not the case  Other types of political patronage may violate the laws or ethics codes  such as when political leaders engage in

scholars have argued that patronage may be used for laudable purposes  such as the  quot recognition quot  of minority communities through the appointment of their members to a high profile positions

and their questions and interpretations respectfully  leaders will encourage participants to continue to participate and to take risks  \n  \n Leaders of discussions should also encourage participants to engage more deeply with texts by asking probing follow up questions  asking for specific passages in texts as support and by summarizing what participants have said and asking if participants want to clarify   In this way  leaders of discussions act as facilitators  Finally  discussion leaders are responsible for providing conclusions or wrap ups to discussions  asking for final questions or clarifications and providing contexts for discussions  \n  \n     Discussion Questions     \n Interpretive questions may have   Aesthetic interpretation One or many one or many   valid answers   Participants in interpretive discussions are asked to interpret various aspects of texts or to hypothesize about   Aesthetic interpretation Intended interpretation intended interpretations   using text based evidence   Other types of discussion questions include fact based and evaluative questions   Fact based questions tend to have one valid answer and can involve recall of texts or specific passages   Evaluative questions ask discussion participants to form responses based on experiences  opinions  judgments  knowledge and or values rather than texts  \n  \n Basic or focus questions are interpretive questions which comprehensively address an aspect of interpretating a selection   Resolving basic or focus questions typically requires investigation and examination of multiple passages within a selection   Cluster questions  which need not be interpretive questions  are optionally prepared by discussion leaders and are often organized to help to resolve the answers to basic or focus questions   Cluster questions may additionally serve as catalysts for further discussions  \n  \n    Semantics    \n   main Semantics   \n  \n     Denotation     \n   main Denotation   \n  \n

' \n  \'  \'  \' Historicity \'  \'  \'  in   philosophy   is the idea or fact that something has historical origin and developed through history  concepts  practices  values  This is opposed to the belief that the same thing  in particular   normative     institution  s or correlated   ideology ideologies    are   nature natural   or   essence essential   and thus exist   Cultural universal universally    \n  \n Historicity relates to the underlying concept of   history    or the intersection of   teleology    the concept and study of progress and purpose     temporality    the concept of time   and   historiography      semiotics   and history of   history     Varying conceptualizations of historicity emphasize linear progress or the repetition or modulation of past events   cn date October 2013    \n  \n    Concepts of historicity    \n In   Phenomenology  philosophy  phenomenology    historicity is the history of constitution of any   intentionality intentional   object  both in the sense of history as   tradition   and in the sense where every individual has its own history  Of course  these two senses are often very similar  One individual \' s history is heavily influenced by the tradition the individual is formed in  but personal history can also produce an object that wouldn \' t be a part of any tradition  In addition  personal historicity doesn \' t develop in the same way as tradition  \n  \n   Martin Heidegger   argued in  \'  \'   Being and Time   \'  \'  that it is temporality that gives rise to history   All things have their place and time  and nothing past is outside of history  \n  \n   Francis Fukuyama   in  \'  \'   The End of History and the Last Man   \'  \'  famously argued that the collapse of   Soviet communism   brought humanity to the  quot end of history quot  whereby the world \' s global dialectical machinations had been resolved with the triumph of liberal capitalism  \n  \n Before Fukuyama    Jean Baudrillard   argued for a different concept of the  quot end of history quot   Baudrillard \' s most in depth writings on the notion of historicity are found in the books  \'  \' Fatal Strategies \'  \'  and  \'  \' The Illusion of the End \'  \'   It is for these writings that he received a full chapter denunciation from the physicist   Alan Sokal    along with   Jean Bricmont     due to his alleged misuse of physical concepts of linear time  space and stability  In contrast to Fukuyama \' s argument  Baudrillard maintained that the  quot end of history quot   in terms of a   teleology teleological   goal  had always been an illusion brought about by modernity \' s will towards progress  civilization and rational unification  And this was an illusion that to all intents and purposes vanished toward the end of the 20th century  brought about by the  quot speed quot  at which society moved  effectively  \' destabilising \'  the linear progression of history  it is these comments  specifically  that provoked Sokal \' s criticism   History was  so to speak  outpaced by its own spectacular realisation  As Baudrillard himself caustically put it  \n  \n   \'  \' The end of history is  alas  also the end of the dustbins of history  There are no longer any dustbins for disposing of old ideologies  old regimes  old values  Where are we going to throw Marxism  which actually invented the dustbins of history   Yet there is some justice here since the very people who invented them have fallen in   Conclusion  if there are no more dustbins of history  \'  \'  this is because History itself has become a dustbin   \'  \' It has become its own dustbin  just as the planet itself is becoming its own dustbin  \'  \'  lt ref gt  \'  \' The Illusion of the End \'  \'   or  \'  \' Selected Writings \'  \'   p  263 lt  ref gt  \n  \n This approach to history is what marks out Baudrillard \' s affinities with the   postmodernism postmodern   philosophy of   Jean Fran  ois Lyotard    the idea that society     and Western society in particular     has  \' dropped out \'  of the grand narratives of history  for example the coming of Communism or the triumph of civilized modern society   But Baudrillard has supplemented this argument by contending that  although this  \' dropping out \'  may have taken place  the global world  which in Baudrillard \' s writing is sharply distinct from a   universal humanity    is  in accordance with its spectacular understanding of itself  condemned to  \' play out \'  this illusory ending in a hyper teleological way     acting out the end of the end of the end   \'  \' ad infinitum \'  \'   Thus Baudrillard argues that     in a manner similar to   Giorgio Agamben   \' s book  \'  \' Means without Ends \'  \'      Western society is subject to the political restriction of means that are justified by ends that do not exist  \n  \n   Michel Rolph Trouillot   offers a different insight into the meaning and uses of Historicity  Trouillot explains that  quot The ways in which what happened and what is said to have happened are and are not the same may itself be historical quot   \n  \n   References   \n   reflist   \n  \n   Category History

\n Chronology is part of   periodization    It is also part of the discipline of   history    including   earth history    the   earth sciences    and study of the   geologic time scale    see    Prehistoric chronologies Prehistoric chronologies   below   \n  \n   Related fields   \n Chronology is the science of locating historical events in time  It relies upon   chronometry    which is also known as timekeeping  and   historiography    which examines the writing of history and the use of historical methods    Radiocarbon dating   estimates the age of formerly living things by measuring the proportion of   carbon 14     isotope   in their   carbon   content    Dendrochronology   estimates the age of trees by   correlation   of the various   growth rings   in their wood to known year by year reference sequences in the region to reflect year to year climatic variation  Dendrochronology is used in turn as a   calibration   reference for   radiocarbon dating   curves  \n  \n   Calendar and era   \n   calendars   \n   Main Calendar   \n The familiar terms  \'  \'   calendar   \'  \'  and  \'  \'   era   \'  \'   within the meaning of a coherent system of numbered calendar years  concern two complementary fundamental concepts of chronology  For example during eight centuries the calendar belonging to the   Christian era    which era was taken in use in the 8th century by   Bede    was the Julian calendar  but after the year 1582 it was the Gregorian calendar    Dionysius Exiguus    about the year 500  was the founder of that era  which is nowadays the most widespread dating system on earth  \n  \n    Ab Urbe condita era    \n   Main Ab urbe condita   \n  \'  \' Ab Urbe condita \'  \'  is   Latin   for  quot from   founding of Rome the founding   of the City    Rome    quot   lt ref gt Literally translated as  quot From the city having been founded quot   lt  ref gt  traditionally set in 753 BC  It was used to identify the Roman year by a few Roman historians  Modern historians use it much more frequently than the Romans themselves did  the dominant method of identifying Roman years was to name the two   consul  s who held office that year  Before the advent of the modern critical edition of historical Roman works  AUC was indiscriminately added to them by earlier editors  making it appear more widely used than it actually was  \n  \n It was used systematically for the first time only about the year 400  by the Iberian historian   Paulus Orosius Orosius      Pope Boniface IV    in about the year 600  seems to have been the first who made a connection between these this era and   Anno Domini     AD 1   AUC 754   \n  \n    Astronomical era    \n   Main Astronomical year numbering   \n Dionysius Exiguus    Anno Domini era  which contains only calendar years  \'  \' AD \'  \'   was extended by   Bede   to the complete   Christian   era  which contains  in addition all calendar years  \'  \' BC \'  \'   but no  \'  \' year zero \'  \'    Ten centuries after Bede  the French astronomers   Philippe de la Hire    in the year 1702  and   Jacques Cassini    in the year 1740   purely to simplify certain calculations  put the   Julian Date Julian Dating System    proposed in the year 1583 by   Joseph Scaliger    and with it an astronomical era into use  which contains a   leap year   zero  which precedes the year 1  AD  but does not exactly coincide with the year 1 BC  \n  \n   Prehistoric chronologies   \n While of critical importance to the historian  methods of determining chronology are used in most disciplines of science  especially   astronomy      geology      paleontology   and   archaeology    \n  \n In the absence of   written history    with its   chronicle  s and    Category King lists king lists    late 19th century archaeologists found that they could develop relative chronologies based on pottery techniques and styles  In the field of   Egyptology      William Flinders Petrie   pioneered sequence dating to penetrate pre dynastic   Neolithic   times  using groups of contemporary artefacts deposited together at a single time in graves and working backwards methodically from the earliest historical phases of Egypt  This method of dating is known as   Seriation  archaeology  seriation    \n  \n Known wares discovered at strata in sometimes quite distant sites  the product of trade  helped extend the network of chronologies  Some cultures have retained the name applied to them in reference to characteristic forms  for lack of an idea of what they called themselves   quot The   Beaker People   quot  in northern Europe during the 3rd millennium BCE  for example  The study of the means of placing pottery and other cultural artifacts into some kind of order proceeds in two phases  classification and typology  Classification creates categories for the purposes of description  and typology seeks to identify and analyse changes that allow artifacts to be placed into sequences  lt ref gt   cite book   last  Greene   first  Kevin   authorlink     title  Archaeology   An Introduction   publisher  University of Newcastle Upon Tyne  date November 2007   location

  Ideally  archaeological materials used for dating a site should complement each other and provide a means of cross checking  Conclusions drawn from just one unsupported technique are usually

High Modernists were predominantly American   expatriate  s living abroad after the war and strongly marked by the war experience  A great deal of literature was written attempting to convey the World War I experience  Among these is Ezra Pound \' s poem   quot Hugh Selwyn Mauberley quot   published in 1920  The poem points out the perceived pointlessness of World War I  but also the loss of faith in the   British Empire   and Western ideals  Another example of literature during this time is the anti war poem  quot Dulce et Decorum Est  quot   written by   Wilfred Owen    This poem contests the deep seated tradition of  \'  \' noblesse oblige \'  \'   and questions the idea of dying for one \' s country   \n  \n The 1960s were a tumultuous time in Western culture  especially in Europe due to the severe restructuring necessary following the aftermath of the Second World War and in the United States due to its controversial participation in both the   Cold War   and South East Asian

including those elements of the world known to modern scientists as  quot natural resources quot   In many areas indigenous people have sustained communities for centuries  and the ecological systems of which they are a component have maintained relative richness and resilience to natural perturbations such as drought or fires  The ecosystems that have been remained predominantly under control and care of indigenous peoples thus tend to be characterized by high   biodiversity    abundant renewable resources  and relatively unexploited nonrenewable resources  For many indigenous groups  the advent of globalization threatens the sustainability of their economies by making their land and knowledge valuable targets as commodities in a globalized economy  \n  \n    Environmental stresses and

this process claimed to have  quot invented quot  this woman \' s cell line  Their rationale for taking the samples and processing them for patenting was that these samples held  quot commercial promise quot  in the scientific world for the discovery of potential medical breakthroughs and that the government  which date November 2010   encourages the patenting of anything which may have a link to such a discovery  The main contention in the debate apart from   ethical   dilemmas over genetic research is the fact that the woman from whom the samples were taken was never consulted about

These divisions are not mutually exclusive  and significant overlaps are often present  as in  quot The International Women \' s Movement in an Age of Transition  1830   1975  quot  It is possible for historians to concern themselves with both the very specific and the very general  although the modern trend has been toward specialization  The area called   Big History   resists this specialization

than as an   art    which traditionally had been the case  Some of the leading advocates of history as a social science were a diverse collection of scholars which included   Fernand Braudel      E  H  Carr      Fritz Fischer      Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie      Hans Ulrich Wehler      Bruce Trigger      Marc Bloch      Karl Dietrich Bracher      Peter Gay      Robert Fogel      Lucien Febvre   and   Lawrence Stone    Many of the advocates of history as a social science were or are noted for their multi disciplinary approach  Braudel combined history with geography  Bracher history with political science  Fogel history with economics  Gay history with psychology  Trigger history with archaeology while Wehler  Bloch  Fischer  Stone  Febvre and Le Roy Ladurie have in varying and differing ways amalgamated history with sociology  geography  anthropology  and economics  More recently  the field of   digital history   has begun to address ways of using computer technology to pose new questions to historical data and generate digital scholarship  \n  \n In opposition to the claims of history as a social science  historians such as   Hugh Trevor Roper      John Lukacs      Donald Creighton      Gertrude Himmelfarb   and   Gerhard Ritter   argued that the key to the historians \'  work was the power of the   imagination    and hence contended that history should be understood as an art  French historians associated with the   Annales School   introduced quantitative history  using raw data to track the lives of typical individuals  and were prominent in the establishment of   cultural history    cf   \'  \'   histoire des mentalit  s   \'  \'    Intellectual historians such as   Herbert Butterfield      Ernst Nolte   and   George Mosse   have argued for the significance of ideas in history  American historians  motivated by the civil rights era  focused on formerly overlooked ethnic  racial  and socio economic groups  Another genre of   social history   to emerge in the post WWII era was  \'  \'   Alltagsgeschichte   \'  \'   History of Everyday Life   Scholars such as   Martin Broszat      Ian Kershaw   and   Detlev Peukert   sought to examine what everyday life was like for ordinary people in 20th century Germany  especially in the   Nazi   period  \n  \n   Marxist historiography Marxist historians   such as   Eric Hobsbawm      E  P  Thompson      Rodney Hilton      Georges Lefebvre      Eugene D  Genovese      Isaac Deutscher      C  L  R  James      Timothy Mason      Herbert Aptheker      Arno J  Mayer   and   Christopher Hill  historian  Christopher Hill   have sought to validate   Karl Marx   \' s theories by analyzing history from a Marxist perspective  In response to the Marxist interpretation of history  historians such as   Fran  ois Furet      Richard Pipes      J  C  D  Clark      Roland Mousnier      Henry Ashby Turner   and   Robert Conquest   have offered anti Marxist interpretations of history   citation needed date September 2012     Feminism Feminist   historians such as   Joan Wallach Scott      Claudia Koonz      Natalie Zemon Davis      Sheila Rowbotham      Gisela Bock      Gerda Lerner      Elizabeth Fox Genovese    and   Lynn Hunt   have argued for the importance of studying the experience of women in the past  In recent years    postmodernism postmodernists   have challenged the validity and need for the study of history on the basis that all history is based on the personal interpretation of sources  In his 1997 book  \'  \' In Defence of History \'  \'     Richard J  Evans    a professor of modern history at   University of Cambridge Cambridge University    defended the worth of history  Another defence of history from post modernist criticism was the Australian historian   Keith Windschuttle   \' s 1994

of history to promote national sentiment has been a high priority   In the United States after World War I  a strong movement emerged at the university level to teach courses in Western Civilization  so as to give students a common heritage with Europe  In the U S  after 1980 attention increasingly moved toward teaching   world history   or requiring students to take courses in non western cultures  to prepare students for life in a globalized economy  lt ref gt Jacqueline Swansinger   quot Preparing Student Teachers for a World History Curriculum in New York  quot   \'  \' History

'  no footnotes date May 2014   \n  \n  \'  \'  \' Intellectual history \'  \'  \'  refers to the   historiography   of major ideas and thinkers   This history cannot be considered without the knowledge of the men and women who created  discussed  wrote about  and in other ways were concerned with ideas  Intellectual history as practiced by   historian  s is parallel to the   history of philosophy   as done by philosophers  and is more akin to the   history of ideas    Its central premise is that ideas do not develop in isolation from the people who create and use them  and that one must study ideas not as abstract propositions but in terms of the culture  lives  and historical contexts that produced them  \n  \n Intellectual history aims to understand ideas from the past by understanding them in context  The term  quot context quot  in the preceding sentence is ambiguous  it can be political  cultural  intellectual  and social  One can read a text both in terms of a chronological context  for example  as a contribution to a discipline or tradition as it extended over time  or in terms of a contemporary intellectual moment  for example  as participating in a debate particular to a certain time and place   Both of these acts of contextualization are typical of what intellectual historians do  nor are they exclusive  Generally speaking  intellectual historians seek to place concepts and texts from the past in multiple contexts  \n  \n It is important to realize that intellectual history is not just the history of intellectuals  It studies ideas as they are expressed in texts  and as such is different from other forms of   cultural history   which deal also with visual and other non verbal forms of evidence  Any written trace from the past can be the object of intellectual history  The concept of the  quot   intellectual   quot  is relatively recent  and suggests someone professionally concerned with thought  Instead  anyone who has put pen to paper to explore his or her thoughts can be the object of intellectual history  A famous example of an intellectual history of a non canonical thinker is   Carlo Ginzburg   \' s study of a 16th century Italian miller    Menocchio    in his seminal work  \'  \' The Cheese and the Worms \'  \'   \n  \n Although the field emerged from European disciplines of  \'  \'   Kulturgeschichte   \'  \'  and  \'  \'   Geistesgeschichte   \'  \'   the historical study of ideas has engaged not only western intellectual traditions but others as well  including those in other parts of the world  Increasingly  historians are calling for a   Global intellectual history   that will show the parallels and interrelations in the history of thought of all human societies  Another important trend has been the   history of the book   and of reading  which has drawn attention to the material aspects of how books were designed  produced  distributed  and read  \n  \n   Intellectual historiography   \n Intellectual history as a self conscious discipline is a relatively recent phenomenon  It has precedents  however  in the   history of philosophy    the   history of ideas    and in   cultural history   as practiced since   Jacob Burckhardt Burckhardt   or indeed since   Voltaire    The history of the human mind  as it was called in the eighteenth century  was of great concern to scholars and philosophers  and their efforts can in part be traced to   Francis Bacon     s call for what he termed a literary history in his   The Advancement of Learning    However  the discipline of intellectual history as it is now understood emerged only in the immediate postwar period  in its earlier incarnation as  quot the   history of ideas   quot  under the leadership of   Arthur Lovejoy    the founder of the   Journal of the History of Ideas    Since that time    Lovejoy   \' s formulation of  quot unit ideas quot  has been discredited and replaced by more nuanced and more historically sensitive accounts of intellectual activity  and this shift is reflected in the replacement of the phrase   history of ideas   by  \'  \' intellectual history \'  \'   \n  \n In the   United Kingdom    the   history of political thought   has been a particular focus since the late 1960s and is associated especially with the Faculty of History at the   University of Cambridge    where until recently such scholars as   John Dunn  political theorist  John Dunn   and   Quentin Skinner   studied European political thought in its historical context  emphasizing the emergence and development of such concepts as the state and freedom    Quentin Skinner Skinner   in particular is renowned for his provocative methodological essays  which were and are widely read by philosophers and practitioners of other humanistic disciplines  and did much to give prominence to the practice of intellectual history  The   University of Sussex   in the UK has also achieved a reputation in this field of study  and the Sussex emphasis on broad interdisciplinary study has been particularly useful in relevant teaching and research  \n  \n In the United States  intellectual history is understood more broadly to encompass many different forms of intellectual output  not just the history of political ideas  and it includes such fields as the history of historical thought  associated especially with   Anthony Grafton   of   Princeton University   and   J G A  Pocock   of   Johns Hopkins University    Formalized in 2010  the History and Culture Ph D  at   Drew University   is one of a few graduate programs in the US currently specializing in intellectual history  both in its American and European contexts  Despite the prominence of early modern intellectual historians  those studying the age from the   Renaissance   to the   Age of Enlightenment Enlightenment     the intellectual history of the modern period has also been the locus of intense and creative output on both sides of the Atlantic  Prominent examples of such work include   Louis Menand   \' s  \'  \'   The Metaphysical Club  A Story of Ideas in America The Metaphysical Club   \'  \'  and   Martin Jay   \' s  \'  \'   The Dialectical Imagination   \'  \'   \n  \n In continental Europe  equivalents of intellectual history can be found  An example is   Reinhart Koselleck     s  \'  \' Begriffsgeschichte \'  \'   history of concepts   though there are methodological differences between the work of Koselleck and his followers and the work of Anglo American intellectual historians  \n  \n   Prominent individuals   \n

to change society and liberate the individual from the restraints of custom or arbitrary authority  all backed up by a world view increasingly validated by science rather than by religion or tradition      lt  ref gt  All these circumstances provided suitable surroundings for development of universalistic  liberal and rational global perspectives in studies of society and its past and writing historical texts  \n  \n In his  \'  \' Essay on customs  1756  \'  \'    Voltaire   studied development of civilization in the world with universal perspective  rejecting tradition  Christian and national frames  He was significantly influenced by   Jacques B  nigne Bossuet   and his work  \'  \' Discourse on the Universal history  1682  \'  \'  when he was first who seriously attempted to write a history of the world  without limits imposed by nation or religion  emphasizing economical  cultural and political history    Imanuel Kant   developed ideas about universally applicable moral imperatives in his work  \'  \' Perpetual Peace  1795  \'  \'  and designed a plan for establishing   Cosmopolitanism cosmopolitan   liberal order which would result in perpetual   peace    Universalism of the 18th century created an ideology which in modern form could be identified as   Civil society modern civil society    \n  \n The emerging of modern historiography is connected with German universities in the 19th century and the significant influence of   Leopold von Ranke   who insisted on objectivity and systematic use of historical documents in the form of authentic primary sources  his credo was to perform reconstruction of the past  quot as it was quot   lt ref gt A  G  Hopkins  p 2  quot Leopold von Ranke founded historical research on the systematic use of

nationalization of history could probably be traced from the earliest phases of creating historical works  it was in the period after the   French revolution   that creating of historical works started to be strongly influenced by national perspectives  and that perspective gradually became globally dominant with its culmination during the 19th and at the beginning of the 20th century  Nationalism was estimated as the proper perspective to such an extent that nationalization of history remained unnoticed till recently  1980s and 1990s  and was not studied in historiography in a scale that would correspond to its significance  \n  \n Many various reasons  depending on the circumstances  caused nationalization of history  Probably the most important is   Romantic nationalism national revival    the important element of which was nationalized history  lt ref gt Kasianov  Terr  p  7   quot In some countries nationalization of history was part of  quot invention of tradition

Nation state nation states    mostly during the 19th century  With the emerging of national states  a global universal approach to writing history lost ground to the nation state and was very much captured by it even in a significant part of the 20th century  lt ref gt A  G  Hopkins  p  2  quot Nevertheless  the cosmopolitan ideal lost ground to the nation state in the nineteenth century and

' \n   Geographically contexts   \n Local history tends to be less documented than other types  with fewer books and artifacts than that of a country or continent  Many local histories are recorded as oral tales or stories and so are more vulnerable than more well known issues  Artifacts of local history are often collected in local history museums  which may be housed in a historic house or other building  Individual historic sites are inherently local  although they may have national or world history importance as well  Many however have little overall historical impact but add depth to the local area  \n  \n    United Kingdom    \n The   British Association for Local History   in the   United Kingdom   encourages and assists in the study of local history as an academic discipline and as a leisure activity by both individuals and groups  Most historic counties in England have record societies and archaeological and historical societies which coordinate the work of historians and other researchers concerned with that area  \n  \n Local history in the UK took a long time to be accepted as an academic discipline  In the 18th and 19th centuries  it was widely regarded as an

Queen Victoria   with the aim of creating an encyclopaedic history of each of the   historic counties of England    The project is coordinated by the   Institute of Historical Research   at the   University of London    The first academic post related to local history was at   Reading University   which appointed a research fellow in local history in 1908  There was a department of local

' \'  \'  \' Historical sociology \'  \'  \'  is a branch of   sociology   focusing on how   society societies   develop through   history    It looks at how   social structures   that many regard as natural are in fact shaped by complex   social process  es  The structure in turn shapes institutions and organizations  and they affect the society   resulting in phenomena ranging from   gender bias   and   income inequality   to   war    \n  \n Contemporary historical sociology is primarily concerned with how the   State  polity  state   has developed since the   Middle Ages    analyzing relations between states  classes  economic and political systems  \n  \n   The use of history in sociology   \n A common phrase regarding this subject is  quot Sociology is history with the hard work left out  history is sociology with the brains left out quot   As time has passed  History and Sociology have historically developed into two different specific academic disciplines  Historical data was used and is used today in mainly these three ways   The first one is  Examining a theory through a Parallel investigation  To correspond with the natural science conceptions of laws  and to look at  or apply various historical material where you gather your resources in order to prove the theory that is applied  Or on the other hand sociologists for the parallel investigation theory could apply the theory to certain cases of investigation but in a different modalities of a more widely used process The second theory that Sociologists mainly use  applying and contrasting certain events or policies  Analyzed by their specific  or what makes them in unique quality of a composition  certain events used by the Sociologist for comparative data can be contrasted and compared  For interpretive Sociologists it is very common for them to use the  \' Verstehen \'  tradition   And lastly  the third way sociologists typically relate is by taking a look at the causalities from a macro point of view  This is Mill \' s method   quot  a  principle of difference  a case with effect and cause present is contrasted with a case with effect and cause absent  and b  principle of agreement  cases with same effects are compared in terms of their  ideally identical  causes  There is an important debate on the usefulness of Mill   s method for sociological research  which relates to the fact that historical research is often based on only few cases and that many sociological theories are probabilistic  not deterministic  lt ref gt Deflem  Mathieu  1997   quot On the

to some Sociologists is the theory that events that happened in past  have some or a lot of influence on events that happen in the future  However the Sociologist Mahoney has a different definition of path dependence  This theory suggests that  quot process  sequence  and temporality quot  have a valid reason for affecting path dependence and the meaning of past historical events  There are three path dependent analyses with an explanation to how each theory works   quot 1  the study of causal processes that are especially sensitive  in a sequence  to early historical events  which are more important than later events  2  these events are contingent occurrences that cannot be explained by prior events or initial conditions  and 3  that once contingent events take place  the path dependent sequence becomes a deterministic pattern  quot  lt ref gt Mahoney  James   quot Path Dependence in Historical Sociology  quot  Welcome to the College of Arts and Sciences at the University

research  General theories are defined as postulates about causal agents and causal mechanisms that are linked to empirical analysis through bridging assumptions  These theories can contribute to substantive knowledge by helping analysts derive new hypotheses  integrate existing findings  and explain historical outcomes  To illustrate these applications  the article considers five different general theories that have guided or could guide historical sociology  functionalist  rational choice  power  neo Darwinian  and cultural theories  A key conclusion that emerges is that scholars must evaluate both the overall merits of general theory and the individual merits of specific general theories quot   lt ref gt Mahoney  James   quot Revisiting General Theory in Historical Sociology  quot

\' ana \'  \'    quot against quot  and               \'  \' khronos \'  \'    quot time quot    is a   chronology chronological   inconsistency in some arrangement  especially a juxtaposition of person s   events  objects  or customs from different periods of time  The most common type of anachronism is an object misplaced in time  but it may be a verbal expression  a technology  a philosophical idea  a musical style  a material textile  a plant or animal  a custom or anything else associated with a particular period in time so that it is incorrect to place it outside its proper temporal domain  \n  \n An anachronism may be either intentional or unintentional  Intentional anachronisms may be introduced into a literary or artistic work to help a contemporary audience engage more readily with a historical period  or for purposes of rhetoric  comedy or shock  Unintentional anachronisms may occur when a writer  artist or performer is insufficiently aware of differences in technology  customs  attitudes  or fashions between two different historical eras  \n  \n   Types    lt     Anchor from redirected  Parachronism  article  use caution     gt  \n   Image Aristotle in

Gomorrah Sodom   is depicted as a typical Dutch city of the painter \' s time   \n The intentional use of older  often obsolete cultural artifacts may be regarded as anachronistic  For example  it could be considered anachronistic for a modern day person to wear a   top hat    write with a   quill    or carry on a conversation in Latin  Such choices may reflect an   Eccentricity  behavior  eccentricity    or an   aesthetic   preference  \n  \n     Parachronism     \n A  \'  \' parachronism \'  \'   from the   Greek language Greek    quot  \'  \'          \'  \'  quot    quot on the side quot   and  quot  \'  \'              \'  \'  quot    quot time quot   is anything that appears in a time period in which it is not normally found  though not sufficiently out of place as to be impossible   \n  \n This may be an object  an idiomatic expression  a technology  a philosophical idea  a musical style  a material  a custom  or anything else sufficiently closely bound to a particular time period as to seem strange when encountered in a later era   They may be objects or ideas which were once common  but are now considered rare or inappropriate   They can take the form of obsolete technology or outdated fashion  \n  \n Examples of parachronisms could include a suburban housewife in the United States around 1960 using a   washboard   for laundry  well after   washing machine  s had become the norm   or a teenager from that time period being an avid fan of   ragtime   music  Often  parachronism is identified when a work based on a particular era \' s state of knowledge is read within the context of a later era   with a different state of knowledge   Many scientific works that rely on theories that have later been discredited have become anachronistic with the removal of those underpinnings  and works of   speculative fiction   often find their speculations outstripped by real world technological developments or scientific discoveries  \n  \n     Prochronism     \n This differs from a  \'  \' prochronism \'  \'   in which the object or idea has not yet been invented when the situation takes place  and therefore could not have possibly existed at the time  A prochronism occurs when an item appears in a temporal context in which it could not yet be present  the object had not yet been developed  the verbal expression had not been coined  the philosophy had not been formulated  the breed of animal had not been developed  the technology had not been created   \n  \n   Image Constantin Lecca   Infratirea moldovenilor si muntenilor jpg thumb

\n Some writings and works of art promoting a political  nationalist or revolutionary cause use anachronism to depict an institution or custom as being more ancient than it actually is  For example  the 19th century Romanian painter   Constantin Lecca   depicts the peace agreement between   Bogdan III cel Orb Ioan Bogdan Voievod   and   Radu cel Mare Radu Voievod     two leaders in Romania \' s 16th century history   with the flags of   Moldavia    blue red  and of   Wallachia    yellow blue  seen in the background  These flags date only from the 1830s  Here anachronism promotes legitimacy

Anachronism is used especially in works of imagination that rest on a historical basis  Anachronisms may be introduced in many ways  for example  in the disregard of the different modes of life and thought that characterize different periods  or in ignorance of the progress of the arts and sciences and other facts of history  They vary from glaring inconsistencies to scarcely perceptible misrepresentation  It is only since the close of the 18th century that this kind of deviation from historical reality has jarred on a general audience   citation needed date June 2014   Sir   Walter

'A  \'  \'  \' historical figure \'  \'  \'  is a famous person in   history    such as   Florence Nightingale   or   Napoleon    \n  \n The significance of such figures in human progress has been debated  Some think they play a crucial role  while others say they have little impact on the broad currents of thought and social change   The concept is generally used in the sense that the person really existed in the past  as opposed to being legendary   However  the legends that can grow up around historical figures may be hard to distinguish from fact   Sources are often incomplete and may be inaccurate  particularly those from early periods of history  Without a body of personal documents  the more subtle aspects of personality of a historical figure can only be deduced  With historical figures who were also religious figures attempts to separate fact from belief may be controversial  \n  \n In education  presenting information as if it were being told by a historical figure may give it greater impact  Since classical times  students have been asked to put themselves in the place of a historical figure as a way of bringing history to life  Historical figures are often represented in fiction  where fact and fancy are combined  In earlier traditions  before the rise of a critical historical tradition  authors took less care to be as accurate when describing what they knew of historical figures and their actions  interpolating imaginary elements intended to serve a moral purpose to events  such is   Notker the Stammerer the Monk of St  Gall   \' s anecdotal account of   Charlemagne     \'  \' De Carolo Magno \'  \'   More recently there has been a tendency once again for authors to freely depart from the  quot facts quot  when they conflict with their creative goals  \n  \n   Significance   \n The significance of historical figures has long been the subject of debate by philosophers     Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel Hegel    1770   1831  considered that  quot world historical figures quot  played a pivotal role in human progress  but felt that they were bound to emerge when change was needed     Thomas Carlyle    1795   1881  saw the study of figures such as   Muhammad      William Shakespeare   and   Oliver Cromwell   as key to understanding history    Herbert Spencer    1820   1903   an early believer in evolution and in the universality of natural law  felt that historical individuals were of little importance  \n  \n    Hegel \' s world historical figure    \n   File Hegel jpg thumb   Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel   introduced the concept of the  quot world historical figure quot     \n The German philosopher Hegel defined the concept of the world historical figure  who embodied the ruthless advance of   Immanuel Kant   \' s World Spirit  often overthrowing outdated structures and ideas   To him    Napoleon   was such a figure   sfn Hagen 2012 p 125   \n Hegel proposed that a world historical figure essentially posed a challenge  or thesis  and this would generate an antithesis  or opposing force  Eventually a synthesis would resolve the conflict   sfn Van Doren 2008 p 277   \n Hegel viewed

failed in his bid to make himself an emperor  and was assassinated  but the empire came into existence soon afterward  and Caesar \' s name has become synonymous with  quot emperor quot  in forms such

views  such as his characterization of   Socrates   as a world historical figure who acted as a destructive force on Greek received views of morality   sfn Stewart 2007 p 179   \n In Hegel \' s view  Socrates broke down social harmony by questioning the meaning of concepts like  quot justice quot  and  quot virtue quot   \n Eventually  the Athenians quite rightly condemned Socrates to death  But they could not stop the evolution of thought that Socrates had begun  which would lead to the concept of individual conscience   sfn Magee 2001 p 192   \n Hegel said of world historical figures  \n   blockquote It was theirs to know this nascent principle  the necessary  directly sequent step in progress  which their world was to take  to make this their aim  and to expend their energy in promoting it     They die early like Alexander  they are murdered  like Caesar  transported to St  Helena  like Napoleon     They are  \'  \' great \'  \'  men  because they willed and accomplished something great  not a mere fancy  a mere intention  but that which met the case and fell in with the needs of the age   sfn Cramer 2007 p 272     \n  \n However  Hegel    Thomas Carlyle   and others noted that the great historical figures were just representative men  expressions of the material forces of history   Essentially they have little choice about what they do  This is in conflict with the views of   George Bancroft   or   Ralph Waldo Emerson    who praised self reliance and individualism  and in conflict with   Karl Marx   and   Friedrich Engels    who also felt that individuals can determine their destiny   sfn Moses 2004 p 5   \n Engels found that Hegel \' s system contained an  quot internal and incurable contradiction quot   resting as it does on both   Hegelian dialectic

figures were relatively unimportant  \n He wrote to a friend   quot I ignore utterly the personal element in history  and  indeed  show little respect for history altogether as it is ordinarily conceived  quot  \n He wrote   quot The  births  deaths   and  marriages of  kings  and other like  historic trivialities  are  committed to memory  not because of any direct benefits that can possibly result from knowing them   but  because society considers them parts of  a good education  quot   sfn Carneiro 1981 p 188   \n In his essay  \'  \' What  Knowledge is of Most Worth  \'  \'  he wrote  \n   blockquote That which  constitutes History   properly  so called  is in great part omitted from works on the subject  Only of late years have historians commenced giving us  in any considerable quantity  the truly valuable information  As in past ages the king was everything and the people nothing  So  in past histories  the doings of the king fill the entire picture  to which the national life forms but an obscure background  While only now  when the welfare of nations rather than of rulers is becoming the dominant idea  are historians beginning to occupy themselves with

extreme  one may consider that what Hegel calls the  quot world spirit quot  and   T  S  Eliot   calls  quot those vast impersonal forces quot  hold us in their grip   What happens is predetermined   sfn White 2004 p 52    \n Both Hegel and Marx advocated historical inevitability in contrast to the doctrine of contingency  allowing for alternative outcomes  that was advocated by   Friedrich Nietzsche      Michel Foucault   and others   sfn Ben Menahem 2011 p chapter 9   \n However  Marx argued against the use of the   quot historical inevitability quot  argument when used to explain the destruction of early communes in Russia   sfn Chakrabarti 2009 p 158   \n As an orthodox Marxist    Vladimir Lenin   accepted the laws of history that Marx had discovered  including the historical

and cannot be predicted scientifically   sfn White 2004 p 52   \n Berlin presented his views in a 1953 lecture at the   London School of Economics    published soon afterwards   When speaking he referred to   Ludwig Wittgenstein   \' s views  but the published version speaks approvingly of Karl Popper  which caused a stir among academics   sfn Agassi 2008 p 152   \n  \n    Heroic view    \n   File Carlyle by Elliott  amp  Fry c1860s jpg thumb   Thomas Carlyle    champion of study of great men   \n   Thomas Carlyle   has espoused the  quot heroic view quot  of history  famously saying in

all     that were a still worse case  quot   sfn Carlyle 1841 p 47   \n Carlyle \' s historical philosophy was based on the  quot   Great Man theory   quot   saying   quot Universal History  the history of what man has accomplished in the world      is  at bottom the History of the Great Men who have worked here  quot  \n An extreme believer in individuality  he also believed that the masses of people should let themselves be guided by the great leaders of men   sfn Carlyle 2007 p 9   \n Talking of poets he said  \n   blockquote That ideal outline of himself  which a man unconsciously shadows forth in his writings  and which  if rightly deciphered  will be truer than any other representation of him  it is the task of the Biographer to fill up into an actual coherent figure  and to bring him to our experience  or at least our clear undoubted admiration  thereby to instruct and edify us in many ways  Conducted on such principles  the Biography of great men  especially of great Poets  that is  of men in the highest degree noble minded and wise  might become one of the most dignified and valuable species of composition   sfn Kerry Hill 2010 p 138     \n More recently  in his

which the  quot great man quot  or  quot hero quot  acted  but asserts that this can provide the backdrop but never the plot of the  quot dramas of human history quot    sfn Hook 1943 p xiii   \n  \n

rankings of the significance of major historical figures   For example  Cesar Hidalgo at the   MIT Media Lab   has calculated the cultural impact of people born before 1950 using data from   Wikipedia     Weightings were determined using factors such as the number of language editions for which there are articles for each person   The top ten which resulted from this calculation was   sfn Hidalgo 2012 p 32   \n  \n   Historical truth   \n It is sometimes hard to discern whether apparently historical figures from the earliest periods did in fact exist  due to the lack of records   Even with more recent personages  stories or anecdotes about the person often accumulate that have no basis in fact   Although the external aspects of a historical figure may be well documented  their inner nature can only be a subject of speculation   With religious figures  often the subjects of voluminous literature  separating  quot fact quot  from  quot belief quot  can be difficult if not impossible  \n  \n    Ancient figures    \n With older texts it can be difficult to be sure whether a person in the text is  in fact  a historical figure   quot Wisdom literature quot  from early middle eastern cultures  such as the Book of Job   mainly consist of verbal expositions or discussions that must be considered the work of the author  rather than the character supposedly speaking  It may still be possible to identify a figure in such texts with a historical figure known from some other context  and the text may be taken as informative about this figure  even if not verified by an independent source   sfn Longman Enns 2008 p 335   On the other hand  a text may include realistic settings and references to historical people  while the central character may or may not be a

\'  \'  quot    sfn Napoleon  amp  Auguste Dieudonn   1823 p 242   Great figures of the past have stories told about them which grow in the telling  and so become   myth  s and   legend  s which may dominate or displace the more prosaic historical facts about them  For example  some ancient chroniclers said that the Emperor   Nero   fiddled while Rome burned  but   Tacitus   disputed this by saying the stories were just malicious rumours  Similarly  there is no good evidence that   Marie Antoinette   ever said  quot let them eat cake quot   or that   Lady Godiva   rode naked through the streets of   Coventry     sfn Andrews 2012   \n  \n    Personality    \n   Thomas Carlyle   pointed out that even to the person living it  every life  quot remains in so many points unintelligible quot    The historian must struggle when writing biographies   quot the very facts of which  to say nothing of the purport of them  we know not  and cannot know  quot   sfn Kerry Hill 2010 p 133 134   \n Some psychologists have sought to understand the personalities of historical figures through clues about the way in which they were raised  However  this theoretical psychoanalytic approach is not supported empirically  An alternative approach  favored by   Psychobiography psychobiographers   such as   William Runyan    is to explain the personality of the historical figure in terms of their life history  This approach has the advantage of recognizing that personality may evolve over time in response to events   sfn Roberts 1996 p 208   \n  \n   File Confucius Laozi Buddha jpg thumb right

figures  Thus the Chinese can recognise that   Mencius   or   Confucius   were historical individuals  while also endowing them with sanctity  In Indian   Hinduism    on the other hand  figures such as   Krishna   or   Rama   are almost always seen as embodiments of gods rather than as historical people  The   Nirvana Sutra   states   quot Do not rely on the man but on the Dharma  quot  A teacher such as   Gautama Buddha   is thus treated almost exclusively as a lesser god rather than a historical figure   sfn Yuasa Kasulis 1987 p 128   \n  \n   E  P  Sanders    author of  \'  \' The

individual liberties  and his views were therefore rejected by the German National Socialists  who considered him dangerously liberal and perhaps a proto Marxist  On the other hand    Adolf Hitler

only to add dramatic effect to the presentation of his own thought   sfn Anton Preus 1971 p 162   For this reason  Plato \' s writings on Socrates tell us little  at least directly  about Socrates  The historical figure is used only as a device for communicating Plato \' s ideas   sfn Anton Preus 1971 p 162   In classical Rome  students of rhetoric had to master the  \'  \'   suasoria   \'  \'

with the   invention of writing    For some regions of the world  written history is limited to a relatively recent period in human history  Moreover  human cultures do not always record all information relevant to later historians  such as natural disasters or the names of individuals  thus  recorded history for particular types of information is limited based on the types of records kept  Because of these limits  recorded history in different contexts may refer to different periods of time depending on the historical topic  \n  \n The interpretation of recorded history often relies on    historical method    or the set of techniques and guidelines by which historians use   primary source  s and other evidence to research and then to write accounts of the past  The question of the nature  and even the possibility  of a sound historical method is raised in the   philosophy of history   as a question of   epistemology    The study of historical method and writing is known as   historiography    \n  \n   Prehistory   \n   File Sumerian 26th c Adab jpg thumbnail right Sumerian inscription in monumental archaic style  c  26th century BCE   \n   further History of

research in the 17th and 18th centuries  especially in France and Germany  where they began investigating these source materials to write histories of their past  Many of these histories  had strong ideological and political ties to their historical narratives  In the 20th century  academic historians began focusing less on epic nationalistic narratives  which often tended to glorify the nation or   great men theory great men    to more objective and complex analyses of social and intellectual forces  A major trend of historical methodology in the 20th century was a tendency to treat history more as a   social science   rather than as an   art    which traditionally had been the case  French historians associated with the   Annales School   introduced quantitative history  using raw data

held because of heavy rains   During 1899 church attendance dropped as church members left town because of the threat of war   The last meeting of the church council  before the Anglo Boer war    Boer Wars     took place on the 2 August 1899   By that November only twenty British subjects were left in Pietersburg   Church records are sparse during the war  but it appears that the rector may have even been imprisoned during 1900   Church services resumed in November 1901  \n  \n After the war  accessible records from old Service Registers  Council Minutes and Vestry Minutes settle into a

of the present church  erf  569  corner of Devenish and Biccard Streets  was purchased complete with a house for use as the Rectory   In 1949 a building fund was started and in 1951 a definite decision was taken to build a new church on the Rectory site  The old building was showing its age  termites had got into the walls and fear was expressed that the roof would eventually become dangerous  lt ref name  quot dioceseofpretoria org quot   gt  \n  \n On the 20th June  1957 the church celebrated its Diamond Jubilee   The guest preacher was the Rev  Frank Clarke  \n  \n In March 1960  the Vicar General  the Very Rev    Frederick Andrew Amoore F A  Amoore    laid the foundation stone of the new hall and vestry  The last service held in the old building that had served this congregation for over sixty years was held on Sunday  25 September 1960  In July  1968 Architects were commissioned to plan the new church and on Saturday 30 November  the foundation stone of the new church was laid by Mr  J A  Goddard  This honour was accorded him in recognition of the many years of devoted and unbroken service he had given to Christ Church since 1927   In 1969 the church and a flat for the curate were completed at a cost of R35 500   The dedication of the church by the   Bishop of Pretoria   took place on Sunday  10 August 1969  lt ref gt  Growing Up in Grace  amp  Going

bishop of the   Anglican Diocese of St Mark the Evangelist   resisted the call for many years to have a   cathedral   in the diocese  He  like his predecessor  Bishop Philip Le Feuvre  believed that the diocese was far from being established and so any talk of establishing a cathedral was premature  lt ref gt  Bishop Martin Breytenbach Ad Clerum  Winter  2010   lt  ref gt  \n  \n In 2009 the bishop began thinking about the needs of Polokwane itself  It is rapidly transforming from a small city into a full scale city  The open land between   Polokwane   and Seshego is rapidly filling up with houses  New suburbs are opening up to the north  east and south   New shopping malls are opening up and existing ones are doubling in size  \n  \n With the support of Chapter  the Trustees  Diocesan Standing Committee and Christ Church Council  the bishop moved towards proclaiming Christ Church a   cathedral   in 2011  A   Dean  Christianity  dean   was appointed as well as a   sub dean      Consequently the list of Rectors was discontinued and a new list of Deans and Sub Deans started    Christ Church was consecrated a cathedral on 18 June 2011  \n  \n    Rectors    \n  \n The

' \n    Basic Overview    \n Also known as the \'  \'  \'  Multistep Flow Model \'  \'  \'  is a theory based on a 1940s study on social influence that states that media effects are indirectly established through the personal influence of opinion leaders  The majority of people receive much of their information and are influenced by the media secondhand  through the personal influence of opinion leaders  \n  \n    Concept    \n The  \'  \' Multistep Flow Model \'  \'  says that most people form their opinions based on opinion leaders that influence the media  Opinion leaders are those initially exposed to a specific media content  and who interpret it based on their own opinion  They then begin to infiltrate these opinions through the   general public   who become  quot opinion

literate understanding of media content  explain and diffuse the content to others  \n  \n Based on the two step flow hypothesis  the term    personal influence    came to illustrate the process intervening between the media   s direct message and the audience   s reaction to that message  Opinion leaders tend to be similar to those they influence   based on personality  interests  demographics  or socio economic factors  These leaders tend to influence others to change their attitudes and behaviors  The two step theory refined the ability to predict how media messages influence audience behavior and explains why certain media campaigns do not alter audiences    attitudes  This hypothesis provided a basis for the multi step flow theory of mass communication  lt ref gt  quot

County  Ohio  Paul Lazarsfeld  Bernard Berelson  and Hazel Gaudet supervised 15 interviewers  who from May   October interviewed the strategically selected 2 400 members of the community several different times in order to document their decision making process during the campaign  They focused on what factors would influence their decisions as the campaign progressed  \n The People   s Choice  a book based on this study presented the theory of     the two step flow of communications     which later came to be associated with the so called    limited effects model    of mass media  the idea that ideas often flow from radio and print to local    opinion leaders    who in turn pass them on to those with more limited political knowledge  quot opinion followers  quot  The conclusion

came the study conducted by the Bureau of Applied Social Research in which 800 female residents of Decatur  Illinois  where interviewed through panel interviews to discover what and who primarily influenced their decision making  Lazarsfeld worked with Robert Merton and thus hired C  Wright Mills to head the study  Another part of the research team  Thelma Ehrlich Anderson  trained local Decatur women to administer surveys to targeted women in town  By 1955  the Decatur study was published as part of Elihu Katz and Lazarsfeld   s book Personal Influence  The book concluded that

opinion leaders  \n  \n Furthermore  the two step hypothesis does not adequately describe the flow of learning  Everett Rogers       Diffusion of Innovations    cites one study in which two thirds of respondents accredited their awareness to the mass media rather than face to face communication  Similarly  critics argue that most of Lazarsfeld   s findings pertain to learning factors involved with general media habits rather than the learning of particular information  Both findings suggest a greater prevalence of a one step flow of communication  \n  \n However  Lazarsfeld   s two step hypothesis is an adequate description to understand the media   s influence on belief and behavior  Troldahl finds that media exposure is a first step to introduce discussion  at which point opinion leaders initiate the second step flow  These findings also realize opinion leaders decisive role in the balance theory  which suggests that people are motivated to keep consistency among their current beliefs and opinions  If a person is exposed to new observations that are inconsistent with present beliefs  he or she is thrown into imbalance  This person will then seek advice from their opinion leader  to provide them with additional cognitions to bring them back into balance  \n  \n   See also   \n    Word of mouth   \n    Word of mouth marketing   \n  \n   References   \n   Reflist   \n

'  Disability   \n The  \'  \'  \' medical model of disability \'  \'  \'  is a sociopolitical model by which illness or   disability    being the result of a physical condition intrinsic to the individual  it is part of that individual   s own body   may reduce the individual \' s   quality of life    and cause clear disadvantages to the individual   \n  \n The   medical model   tends to believe that curing or at least managing illness or disability mostly or completely revolves around identifying the illness or disability from an in depth clinical perspective  in the sense of the   scientific   understanding undertaken by trained   Health care provider healthcare providers     understanding it  and learning to control and or alter its course  By extension  the medical model also believes that a  quot compassionate quot  or   justice just   society invests resources in health care and related services in an attempt to cure disabilities  \'  \' medically \'  \'   to expand functionality and or improve functioning  and to allow disabled persons a more  quot normal quot  life  The   medical   profession \' s responsibility and potential in this area is seen as central  \n  \n    Historical Development of Model    \n  \n     Original WHO Definition for Disability     \n In 1980 the WHO introduced a framework for working with disability  publishing the  quot International Classification of Impairments  Disabilities and Handicaps quot   The framework they proposed approached disability using the terms Impairment  Handicap and Disability \n   lt ref gt WHO  International Classification of Impairments  Disabilities and Handicaps 1980 lt  ref gt  \n   Impairment   a loss or abnormality of physical bodily structure or function  of logic psychic origin  or physiological or anatomical origin \n  Disability   any limitation or function loss deriving from impairment that prevents the performance of an activity in the time lapse considered normal for a human being \n  Handicap   the disadvantaged condition deriving from impairment or disability limiting a person performing a role considered normal in respect of their age  sex and social and cultural factors \n  \n     Current Definitions     \n The International Classification of Functioning  Disability and Health  ICF  defines disability as an umbrella term for impairments  activity limitations and participation restrictions  Disability is the interaction between individuals with a health condition  e g  cerebral palsy  Down syndrome and depression  and personal and environmental factors  e g  negative attitudes  inaccessible transportation and public buildings  and limited social supports  \n   lt ref gt WHO  Fact sheet N  352  June 2011  Accessed at http   www who int mediacentre factsheets fs352 en index html 20 July 2012 lt  ref gt   \n  \n The altered language and words used show a marked change in emphasis from talking in terms of disease or impairment  to talking in terms of levels of health and functioning  This change is consistent with widespread acceptance of the   social model of disability    \n  \n   Criticism   \n The Medical Model of Disability focuses on the individual \' s limitations and ways to reduce those impairments or using adaptive technology to adapt them to society  Current definitions of disability accept biomedical assistance but focus more on factors causing environmental and social exclusion  Uncritical reliance on the Medical Model produces unwanted consequences  \n  \n Among advocates of   disability rights    who tend to subscribe to   social model of disability the social model   instead  the medical model of disability is often cited as the basis of an unintended social   wikt degradation degradation   of disabled people  further  resources are seen as excessively misdirected towards an almost exclusively medical focus when those same resources could be used towards things like   universal design   and   inclusion  disability rights  societal inclusionary practices    This includes the monetary and the societal costs and benefits of various interventions  be they medical  surgical  social or occupational  from   prosthetics    drug based and other  quot cures quot   and medical tests such as genetic screening or   preimplantation genetic diagnosis    Often  a medical model of disability is used to justify large investment in these procedures  technologies and research  when adaptation of the disabled person \' s environment might ultimately be more beneficial to the society at large  as well as financially cheaper and physically more attainable  \n  \n Further  some disability rights groups see the medical model of disability as a   civil rights   issue  and criticise   Charitable organization charitable   or medical initiatives that use it in their portrayal of disabled people  because it promotes a   pity pitiable    essentially negative  largely   disempowered   image of people with disabilities  rather than casting disability as a political  social and environmental problem   \'  \' see also the   political slogan    quot   piss on pity   quot  \'  \'    Various

' \n While the concept of a political   climate   has been used historically to describe both   politics   and public reactions to political actions in various forms  the naming of the concept by the addition of the modifier    political    to the base    climate    has been fairly recent    Public opinion   is also widely used incorrectly as a synonym for political climate  \n  \n As for judging what the climate is at any given time  there is no way to know an entire country \' s views on certain subjects  So    Opinion poll polls   are used to estimate what the political climate  quot feels quot  like on a regular basis  However  this only works to some degree as polls cannot involve the entire population at once  \n  \n   Etymology   \n  \n    Climate    \n According to the   Oxford English Dictionary    the base climate comes from the Middle French climat  which was first used to describe a region \' s prevailing weather conditions around 1314  lt ref gt  quot climate  quot

Socrates   the self described  quot gadfly0 quot  of Athens because of his practice of  \'  \' elenchos \'  \'   critical interrogation   seen by many as being anti democratic and thus a traitor to

Main Public opinion   \n The phrase originates from the French term  \'  \' opinion publique \'  \'   which was first attributed to   Montaigne    the father of modern   Skepticism   and a major figure of the   French Renaissance    around 1588 C E  lt ref gt Donsbach  Wolfgang   \'  \' The International Encyclopedia of Communication \'  \'   Wiley Blackwell  2008  Print  lt  ref gt  \n It is generally used to describe the overall opinion of the public body about a certain issue  The phrase is commonly used interchangeably with political climate but the two actually refer to separate concepts    Public opinion   is the aggregate logical thoughts that the public thinks and expresses about an issue  which does not have to be political in nature   while political climate is what the public \' s emotional reaction to those logical thoughts are  \n  \n Depending on the nature of the thoughts  if they are considered controversial or extreme   the emotional reaction can range from nothing to a highly violent state  Accordingly  controversial issues in the public eye are usually accompanied by or can even produce a polarizing political climate  For example the introduction  passing  and court fight over   Proposition 8   in   California   brought a controversial issue into the public sphere  which resulted in such a drastic change in the political climate of the   United States   as to produce many protests throughout the nation  some of them violent  lt ref gt Dolan  Maura   quot Prop  8  Protesters on both sides of gay marriage issue make their views known outside

  opinion poll   is a survey of public opinion from a particular group of people or sample  For determining the political climate  this usually would be a   cross sectional data cross section   of the population in question  Opinion polls conduct series of questions and then extrapolate the average opinion of the sample according to their answers  However  opinion polls generally have appreciative margins of error because of the inability to survey the entire population and the improbability of surveying a perfectly random cross section of the population  For example  the   Wall Street Journal   estimated in 2006 that the average margin of error is about 3 5  in opinion polls because of a wide variety of potential inaccuracies such as   response bias   and   selection bias    lt ref gt

\n Opinion polls are also known to be entirely incorrect when predicting the outcome of certain events  The best known example of this is the   1948 US presidential election    in which the prediction was that   Thomas Dewey   would easily defeat   Harry Truman    Major polling organizations  including   George Gallup Gallup   and   Elmo Roper Roper    indicated a landslide victory for Dewey when  in fact  Truman was the victor in a close election and kept the presidency  lt ref gt Crabtree  Steve   quot Strom Thurmond and the 1948 Election  quot  Gallup Brain  A Publication of Gallup  Inc

recently emerged as a central aspect of political demography  This has come about due to medical advances which have lowered infant mortality while conquest migrations have faded as a factor in world history  Differences in immunity levels to infectious diseases between populations also play no major role in our age of modern medicine and widespread exposure to a common disease pool  It is not so much the trajectory of demographic transition that counts as the fact that it has become more intense and uneven in the late twentieth century as it has spread into the developing world  Uneven transitions lend themselves to differential growth rates between contending groups  These changes are  in turn  magnified by democratization  which entrenches majority rule and privileges the power of numbers in politics as never before  Indeed  in many new democracies riven by ethnic and religious conflicts  elections are akin to censuses while groups seek to  \' win the census \'   Ethnic parties

' \n   Criminology and penology   \n  \'  \'  \' Criminalization \'  \'  \'  or  \'  \'  \' criminalisation \'  \'  \'   in   criminology    is  quot the process by which behaviors and individuals are transformed into   crime   and criminals quot   lt ref gt Michalowski p  6  lt  ref gt  Previously legal acts may be transformed into crimes by   legislation   or judicial decision  However  there is usually a formal presumption in the rules of   statutory interpretation   against the   ex post facto law retrospective application of laws   and only the use of express words by the   legislature   may rebut this presumption  The power of judges to make new law and retrospectively criminalise behaviour is also discouraged  In a less overt way  where laws have not been strictly enforced  the acts prohibited by those laws may also undergo  \'  \' de facto \'  \'  criminalisation through more effective or committed legal enforcement  \n  \n   The problems   \n There has been some uncertainty as to the nature and extent of the contribution to be made by the victims of crime  But  as Garkawe  2001  indicates  the relationship between   victimology   and   criminology   has become problematic  The concern is that  within the   dialectic   of   Right Realism   and   Left realism Left Realism    lt ref gt Walklate  2003   lt  ref gt  a focus on the victim promotes rights selectively for certain victims  and advocates the assumption that some victim rights are more important than competing rights or values in society  lt ref gt Elias  1993   lt  ref gt  For example  an   Islamic     feminism feminist   might seek consistency of treatment for women as victims and  therefore  demand the decriminalization of abortion  adultery  and seduction    Zina   is a   Hudud   offense in   sharia sharia law     and the criminalization of   domestic violence   and   sexual harassment    \n  \n In formal academically published theory  the real ruling class of a society reaches a temporary view on whether certain acts or behavior are harmful or criminal  Historically this one theory will be modified by scientific  medical evidence  by political change  and the criminal justice system may or may not treat those matters as crimes  \n  \n Conversely  when local politics determines that it is no longer a crime  they may be decriminalized  For example  Recommendation No  R  95  12 adopted by the   Council of Europe Committee of Ministers Committee of Ministers   of the   Council of Europe   on the management of criminal justice  advocates that crime policies such as decriminalization  depenalisation or diversion  and mediation should be adopted wherever possible  But the law and order debate between right and left politicians is often superficial and unscientific  formulating policies based on their appeal to an uniformed electorate rather than properly conducted research  lt ref gt Currie  1991   lt  ref gt  \n  \n   Principles   \n Several principles may underpin decisions about criminalization  These include the  \'  \'   de minimis   \'  \'  principle  that of the minimum criminalization  lt ref name  quot ashworth67 quot  gt Ashworth  1999   p  67  lt  ref gt  Under this principle  the general harm principle fails to consider the possibility of other sanctions and the effectiveness of criminalization as a chosen option  Those other sanctions include civil courts  laws of   tort   and   regulation    Having criminal remedies in place is seen as a  quot last resort quot  since such actions often infringe personal liberties  amp ndash    incarceration    for example  prevents the freedom of movement  In this sense  law making that places a greater emphasis on   human rights    Most crimes of direct actions    murder      rape      assault    for example  are generally not affected by such a stance  but it does require greater justification in less clear cases  lt ref name  quot ashworth67 quot   gt  \n  \n The policy of  quot social defense quot  can be seen as an opposing view  It argues that criminalization is used against  quot any form of activity which threatens good order or is thought reprehensible quot   The minimization principle may unwittingly prevent the adaptation of the law to new situations  lt ref name  quot ashworth67 quot   gt  In general  worldwide policy makers have created a myriad of smaller offences  in contradiction to the minimization principle and more in keeping with the social defence  lt ref name  quot ashworth68 quot  gt Ashworth  1999   p  68  lt  ref gt  \n  \n    Harm    \n

objective reasons are needed to demonstrate that it is fair to criminalize conduct in any given case  The commonly cited objective justification for invoking the criminal law is harm to others  but it cannot deal with all situations  For example  people are not necessarily harmed by public nudity  Feinberg suggests that offence to others also provides an objective reason for invoking the criminal law  but it clearly does not as offence is determined according to conventional morality  \n  \n People experience a range of physical and social injuries in different contexts which will vary according to the level of economic and political development of their country  Some will be injured out of   poverty   and   malnutrition    others by   violence   which might stem from a major conflict such as   war   or from the personal violence in a   robbery    The   natural environment environment   may be damaged by   pollution    there may be hazards at work  Many of these sources of injury will be ignored while the state may delegate powers of control to a number of different agencies within an international framework where   supranationalism supranational   agencies and   human rights   organisations may offer assistance in responding to the causes of those injuries  \n  \n    Moral approaches and autonomy    \n The extent to which behaviours considered   morally wrong   in a given jurisdiction should be criminalized is controversial  lt ref gt Ashworth  1999   pp  42 amp ndash 43  lt  ref gt  Lying or breaking promises are not in general criminalised  for example    Patrick Devlin  Baron Devlin Patrick Devlin   believed that moral behaviour was essential in maintaining the cohesion of a state  and so lawmakers should be entitled to criminalise immoral behaviour  lt ref name  quot ashworth43 quot  gt Ashworth  1999   p  43  lt  ref gt  However  opponents of this approach typically suggest use of a harm principle only and that immorality is not a reason in itself since outcomes of such activity can be used to come to a conclusion alone  Devlin \' s argument uses the disgust of the general public as a definition of morality  however  issues involving   prejudice   have shown this to be flawed and opponents push for a much stricter definition if this approach is to be used  lt ref name  quot ashworth43 quot   gt  Devlin suggested a jury to give an indication of immoral behaviour  As well as prejudice  views were likely to vary widely on issues such as   homosexuality      contraception   and other matters  particularly those influenced by

argues that the state cannot and should not enforce morality  rather  any attempt to limit individual autonomy should be done only to limit harm  Certain moral ideals may be justifiable if they extend autonomy  If the immoral conduct of others impinges on someone else \' s autonomy  then that can be legislated against  lt ref name  quot ashworth45 quot  gt Ashworth  1999   p  45  lt  ref gt  There

Ashworth  1999   p  46  lt  ref gt  The justification for this was the concept of shock or offensive to the public  Such a line was favoured by   Joel Feinberg    who argued that it was a good reason in support of legislation if it effectively prevented  quot serious offence quot  to persons other than the   actor  law  actor    lt ref name  quot ashworth46 quot   gt  Philosophers such as Feinberg struggle to quantify the ideology behind the illegality of acts which in another setting would be acceptable  that acts themselves not causing harm  for example   for example   nudity    Since such acts publicly are made illegal on the basis of shock  then whether to criminalise depends on a shifting body of public opinion  which varies from place to place and from time to time  The concept of  quot insult quot  rather than  quot offensive quot  may be more specific  lt ref gt Ashworth  1999   pp  46 amp ndash 47  lt  ref gt  \n  \n    Omission    \n   main Omission  criminal law    \n

behaviour that produces it  there are no pre set criteria to apply in formulating social policy  There is no   ontology ontological   reality to crime  The criminal justice system responds to a substantial number of events that do not produce significant hardship to individual citizens  Moreover  events which do cause serious injuries and perhaps should be dealt with as crimes  e g  situations of   corporate manslaughter    are either ignored or dealt with as civil matters  \n  \n The criminalisation process defines and classifies behaviour  It broadcasts the laws so that no one may have the   excuse   of   ignorantia juris non excusat ignorance    and disposes of those who will not obey  There are now more criminal laws and they are penetrating deeper into the social structures of modern societies  Crime control has become an industry  yet it remains ineffective in providing protection to all its citizens from harm  Such as it is  the process is made up of three components  \n  Creation of a social order  This is both a socio economic process  a  quot    fundamental ordering of social relations so that those things necessary for social survival can be produced and distributed in some predictable fashion quot  and an ideological process so that there can be a  quot    development of values  beliefs  and ideas related to the concrete tasks of production and distribution  quot  p  amp nbsp 6   Thus  society must develop the apparatus of law creation  law enforcement and   punishment   and the system must be acceptable to the majority of those who live in the community  If the laws do not match the general   mores    their enforcement will be a source of friction and disharmony  Conformity to the social order must  for the most part  be self enforced  \n  For the times when self enforcement fails  society must create a legal order  This part of the process sees the centralisation of power within the institutions of the political state   Some states justified the criminalisation process as demonstrating their concerns about safety and security  the policy of control  policing  criminal justice  and penal practice  The modern state is   decentralisation decentralising   and   privatisation privatising   its functions  This is changing the character and content of the remaining institutions of the state which must now work co operatively with other for profit agencies  \n  The political order must realign so that the remaining political entities such as   legislature  s and   judge  s set agreed targets for state control and then produce actual outputs of the legal order  i e  of people defined as criminal and processed through that system  \n  \n   Ontological basis of crime   \n  \n Put in the most simple terms  ontology deals with or establishes the clear grounds for being   Heidegger  Martin  Being and Time  introduction  referencing Plato \' s Parmenides   In some of the traditional schools  such as those of the post 1688 English or Americans  many of the writings of the American Founding Fathers  but especially The Federalist  and their Dutch predecessors  see Kossmann  E  H  Political Thought in the Dutch Republic  2004  ontology proper is deemed beyond the scope of legal thought  in accord with the modern distinction between society and state  which some consider based in the distinction the Romans made between themselves and their Italian allies  the socii  but not given the theoretical articulation we recognize today until emphasized by Thomas Hobbes \'  Leviathan  See   State  polity  state     However  some classical theorists  such as Aristotle  in his Politics and Metaphysics  and to a lesser degree in his Topics   Citation needed date November 2008   suggest that the distinction is at least problematic  One need consider no further than the claim that man is a political animal to see this is so  \n  \n As a political animal  man has come to see himself as possessed of rights  lt ref gt UN Human Rights Council  http   www ohchr org english bodies hrcouncil  lt  ref gt  whether these are the   Rights of Englishmen   of old  or the universal human rights advocated vigorously toward establishment today through the matrix of commercialism  lt ref gt International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights  http   www unhchr ch html menu3 b a cescr htm  lt  ref gt  At least in the today dominant American model  deprivation of right amounts to injury  consider especially Justice Stevens dissenting opinion in   Castle Rock v  Gonzales     and injury   so goes the prevailing theory   amounts  when coupled with requisite intent  in most cases  to crime  when it does not admit of civil redress  Thus  again in simple terms  and to the extent that human beings are indeed political beings  crime does seem to have an ontological basis   For one approach to the question of criminal ontology  see  quot Understanding Crime and Social Control in Market Economies  Looking Back and Moving Forward quot  by Robert Bohm in Jeffrey Ian Ross  ed  Cutting the Edge  Current Perspectives in Radical Critical Criminology and Criminal Justice  Westport  Conn  Praeger  1998   This  further  seems to hold if ontology itself is divided into political and trans  or supra  or meta  political ontology   i e   what once was the realm of Christian theology  Of course  it does not matter whether that theology is Christian or belonging to some other apolitical belief  The point is that one may  with some justice  argue persuasively that being is divided  This need not  however  force the question of meta political crimes  Our purposes here  in this article  are limited to the political  For the question in general see   Ontology    \n  \n Baker  argues that only objective harms and other objective bad consequences  or actions in the case of inchoate and endangerment offenses  are prima facie criminalizable  By other bad consequences Baker means privacy violations and conduct that does not necessarily result in tangible harm  but does result in unwanted consequences  Baker argues that the privacy violations that result from being forced to receive unwanted obscene information in public places  exhibitionism  would amount to a sufficient bad consequence for the purposes of invoking the criminal law   but argues that proportionate punishment means that such conduct should only be punished with fines rather than jail terms  \n  \n   See also   \n     Decriminalization    the reversal of criminalization \n     Social rejection

' \n   Image Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at Columbia 4 by David Shankbone jpg thumb Two men arguing politics outside Iranian President   Mahmoud Ahmadinejad   \' s speech at   Columbia University   in 2007   A  \'  \'  \' political argument \'  \'  \'  is an instance of a   logical argument   applied to   politics    Political arguments are used by   academia academics    media   pundit  politics  pundits    candidates for political office and government officials  Political arguments are also used by citizens in ordinary interactions to comment about and understand political events  More often than not  political arguments tend to be circular  repeating the same facts as premises under perhaps slightly different guises  Much political argument concerns issues of taxation and government spending   citation needed date July 2012   \n  \n Political argument should be distinguished from   propaganda    in that propaganda has little or no structure or the rationale  if it exists  is egregiously   fallacy fallacious    \n  \n A classic example of political arguments are those contained in  \'  \'   The Federalist Papers   \'  \'  arguing in favor of ratification of the   American constitution    \n  \n There are several ways of classifying political argument  \n  \n   Based on the purpose of the argument  \n  \n   Based on the logical structure of the argument  \n  \n   Based on the subject matter dealt with in the argument  \n  \n    Purpose of political argument    \n  \n The purpose of argument is usually to sway belief  Political argument can occur in the context of political theory  for instance   Machiavelli   \' s  \'  \'   The Prince   \'  \'  can be regarded as advice to rulers based on various kinds of arguments  Political argument though is not generally a purely intellectual activity  since it may also serve the strategic goal of promoting a political agenda   One usually thinks of political argument as exclusive to democracies  but in fact some kinds of political argument may occur in undemocratic regimes as well  for example  to encourage greater sacrifice from the population  although it is more likely in such cases that   propaganda   will take the place of argument   In a   democracy    though  political argument is particularly important  since there is a direct relation between the beliefs of citizens and the structure of power  Moreover the institutions of a democracy in part define the relationships between beliefs and power   In this case  political argument is an important element of   political strategy    It is also possible that in a democracy  propaganda may also replace argument  indeed  much political advertisement has no discernible logical structure  and in our definition falls under propaganda  \n  \n This view of political argument in a democracy is closely related to the problem of   social choice    Consider a social decision   model  abstract  model   of the kind used in the   theory of social choice    such as used in stating   Arrow \' s theorem      In this model society has a set of individuals  \'  \' X \'  \'  and it faces a set  political  alternatives  \'  \' A \'  \'  which need to be ranked in some way   A  \'  \' ranking \'  \'  is a   binary relation relation    \'  \' R \'  \'  between the elements of  \'  \' A \'  \'  which is   transitive relation transitive   and   reflexive relation reflexive    Note that two alternatives  \'  \' a \'  \'    \'  \' b \'  \'  can satisfy  \'  \' a R b \'  \'  and  \'  \' b R a \'  \'   If this is the case  we say  \'  \' R \'  \'  is indifferent to  \'  \' a \'  \'    \'  \' b \'  \'    Each individual  \'  \' x \'  \'  in  \'  \' X \'  \'  will have an idiosyncratic ranking  \'  \' R \'  \'  lt sub gt  \'  \' x \'  \'  lt  sub gt  of the alternatives in  \'  \' A \'  \'   A  \'  \' profile \'  \'  is any function  \'  \' P \'  \'  that associate to each individual  \'  \' x \'  \'  a ranking of alternatives  \'  \' P \'  \'  lt sub gt  \'  \' x \'  \'  lt  sub gt   a profile is thus a function from  \'  \' X \'  \'  to rankings of  \'  \' A \'  \'   An arbitration scheme  or constitution or voting scheme  is a way of producing a ranking  \'  \' R \'  \'  lt sub gt soc lt  sub gt  for the whole society from any profile  \'  \' P \'  \'   Thus an arbitration scheme is itself a function  \'  \' P \'  \'       \'  \' R \'  \'  lt sub gt soc lt  sub gt   \n  \n Though any argument about politics is in a sense a political argument  an  \'  \' effective \'  \'  political argument is one that can actually change the social preference ranking   \'  \' Effective \'  \'  political argument is a concept distinct from  \'  \' valid \'  \'  political argument  \n  \n     Example     \n   POV check date December 2008   \n Consider an idealized system of tax policy  tax is based on a tax cutoff point  \'  \' T \'  \'   that is individuals with income in excess of  \'  \' T \'  \'  pay taxes  everyone else pays no taxes    In a simple majority rule social arbitration scheme  one might expect that a natural tax rate  \'  \' T \'  \'  can be determined  the   median   income  plus 1   However  a  possibly fallacious  political argument might attempt to change individual \' s  \'  \' voting by their pocket book \'  \'  by arguing that investment in capital and general welfare will increase by reducing taxes on higher income levels  that is raising the tax cutoff point   \n  \n A political argument may be ineffective but may still have a purpose  for instance as a justification for an unpopular political action  or as part of a historical narrative  \n  \n    Structure of political argument    \n  \n Any argument claims to prove something  In the case of arguments used in politics  this something is an assertion about an element of the public sphere  such as economic policy  the environment  decisions about war and peace  abortion etc    An argument cannot start from purely logical principles   An argument is based on premises and some methods for reasoning from premises to conclusions   The validity of an argument in politics can be evaluated in at least two ways  in purely semantic terms or in terms of adherence to certain rules of  argument  which  we can consider rules of fairness    \n  \n Semantically  one should note that some of the  premises used in an argument and the relationships between the assertions in the argument  are associated to specific models of economic or political processes  Other premises are moral assumptions  whether a particular action is good or desirable   For example  arguments concerning  war against and must consider questions about specific threats that the adversary poses  the likelihood of success  the cost of war and so on  In practice  purely semantical evaluations of argument validity are extremely difficult to formulate in  a politically neutral way  since political positions usually involve commitment to some model of social and economic processes  \n  \n    References    \n  \n   A  Hamilton  J  Jay and J  Madison   \'  \' The Federalist \'  \'   Modern Library paperback edition  2001 \n  \n   K  Arrow   \'  \'

political realm can be dated to the late 17th century  However  opinion had been regarded as having singular importance since far earlier     William Shakespeare   had called public opinion the  \' mistress of success \'  and   Blaise Pascal   thought it was  \' the queen of the world  \'  \n   John Locke   in his influential treatise  \'  \'   An Essay Concerning Human Understanding   \'  \'  considered that man was subject to three laws  the divine law  the civil law  and most importantly in Locke \' s judgement  the law of opinion or reputation  He regarded the latter as of the highest importance because dislike and  \'  \' ill opinion \'  \'  force people to conform in their behaviour to social norms  however he didn \' t consider public opinion as a suitable influence for governments  \n  \n   Sir William Temple  1st Baronet William Temple   in his essay of 1672   \'  \' On the Original and Nature of Government \'  \'  gave an early formulation of the importance of public opinion  He observed that  quot    when vast numbers of men submit their lives and fortunes absolutely to the will of one  it   must be force of custom  or opinion   which subjects power to authority  quot  \n  \n Temple disagreed with the prevalent opinion that the basis of government lay in a   social contract   and thought that government was merely allowed to exist due to the favour

to read the   Bible   in the vernacular  and the rapidly expanding printing presses  During the 18th century religious literature was replaced with secular literature  novels and pamphlets  In parallel to this was the growth in reading societies and clubs  At the turn of the century the first circulating library opened in London and the   public library   became widespread and available to

Governments increasingly recognized the importance of managing and directing public opinion  This trend is exemplified in the career of   George Canning   who restyled his political career from its

conceptional tools of his theory of   Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft    argued  1922   quot  \'  \' Kritik der   ffentlichen Meinung \'  \'  quot    that  \' public opinion \'  has the equivalent   social function   in societies   \'  \' Gesellschaften \'  \'   which   religion   has in communities   \'  \' Gemeinschaften \'  \'    lt ref gt Rolf Fechner   Lars Clausen   Arno Bamm    eds     \'

discussion of public opinion  The Public Sphere  or bourgeois public  is according to Habermas  where  quot something approaching public opinion can be formed quot   2004  p  amp nbsp 351   Habermas claimed that the Public Sphere featured universal access  rational debate  and disregard for rank  However  he believes that these three features for how public opinion are best formed are no longer in place in western   Liberal democracy liberal democratic   countries  Public opinion  in western democracy  is highly susceptible to elite manipulation  \n  \n The American sociologist   Herbert Blumer   has proposed an altogether different conception of the  quot public  quot  According to Blumer  public opinion is discussed as a form of   collective behavior    another specialized term  which is made up of those who are discussing a given public issue at any one time  Given this definition  there are many publics  each of them comes into being when an issue arises and ceases to exist when the issue is resolved  Blumer claims that people participate in public in different capacities and to different degrees  So  public opinion polling cannot measure the public  An educated individual \' s participation is more important than that of a drunk  The  quot mass  quot  in which people independently make decisions about  for example  which brand of toothpaste to buy  is a form of collective behavior different from the public  \n  \n Public opinion plays an important role in the political sphere  Cutting across all aspects of relationship between government and public opinion are studies of voting behavior  These have registered the distribution of opinions on a wide variety of issues  have explored the impact of special interest groups on election outcomes and have contributed to our knowledge about the effects of government propaganda and policy  \n  \n Contemporary  quantitative approaches to the study of public opinion may be divided into 4 categories  \n   quantitative measurement of opinion distributions  \n   investigation of the internal relationships among the individual opinions that make up public opinion on an issue  \n   description or analysis of the public role of public opinion  \n   study both of the communication media that disseminate the ideas on which opinions are based and of the uses that propagandists and other manipulators make of these media  \n  \n The rapid spread of public opinion measurement around the world is reflection of the number of uses to which it can be put  Public opinion can be accurately obtained through   survey sampling    Both private firms and governments use   opinion poll surveys   to inform public policies and public relations  \n  \n   Formation   \n Numerous theories and substantial evidence exists to explain the formation and dynamics of individuals \'  opinions  Much of this research draws on psychological research on   Attitude  psychology  attitudes    In   communications studies   and   political science      mass media   are often seen as influential forces on public opinion  Additionally    political socialization   and   behavioral genetics   sometimes explain public opinion  \n  \n    Mass media effects on public opinion    \n The formation of public opinion starts with   Agenda setting theory agenda setting   by major media outlets throughout the world  This agenda setting dictates what is newsworthy and how and when it will be reported  The media agenda is set by a variety of different environmental and newswork factors that determines which stories will be newsworthy  \n  \n Another key component in the formation of public opinion is   Framing  social sciences  framing    Framing is when a story or piece of news is portrayed in a particular way and is meant to sway the consumers attitude one way or the other  Most political issues are heavily framed in order to persuade voters to vote for a particular candidate  For example  if Candidate X once voted on a bill that raised income taxes on the middle class  a framing headline would read  quot Candidate X Doesn \' t Care About the Middle Class quot   This puts Candidate X in a negative frame to the news reader  \n  \n Social desirability is another key component to the formation of public opinion  Social desirability is the idea that people in general will form their opinions based on what they believe is the prevalent opinion of the social group they identify with  Based on media agenda setting and media framing  most often a particular opinion gets repeated throughout various news mediums and social networking sites  until it creates a false vision where the perceived truth can actually be very far away from the actual truth  \n  \n Public opinion can be influenced by   public relations   and the   political media    Additionally    mass media   utilizes a wide variety of   advertising   techniques to get their message out and change the minds of people  Since the 1950s    television   has been the main   mass media medium   for molding public opinion  lt ref name  quot Diggs Brown2011p53 quot  gt Diggs Brown  Barbara  2011   http

Opinion   \n There have been a variety of academic studies investigating whether or not public opinion is influenced by  quot influentials  quot  or persons that have a significant effect on influencing opinion of the general public regarding any relevant issues   Many early studies  Katz and Lazarsfeld  1955  Lazarsfeld et al   1968  have modeled the transfer of information from   mass media   sources to the general public as a  quot two step quot  process   In this process  information from mass media and other far reaching sources of information influences influentials  and influentials then influence the general public as opposed to the mass media directly influencing the public  \n  \n While the  quot two step quot  process regarding public opinion influence has motivated further research on the role of influential persons  a more recent study by Watts and Dodds  2007  suggests that while influentials play some role in influencing public opinion   quot non influential quot  persons that make up the general public are also just as likely  if not more likely  to influence opinion provided that the general public is composed of persons that are easily influenced   This is referred to in their work as the  quot Influential Hypothesis  quot   The authors discuss such results by using a model to quantify the number of people influenced by both the general public and influentials   The model can be easily customized to represent a variety of ways that influencers interact with each other as well as the general public   In their study  such a model diverges from the prior paradigm of the  quot two step quot  process   The Watts and Dodds  2007  model introduces a model of influence emphasizing lateral channels of influence between the influencers and general public categories   This thus leads to a more complex flow of influence amongst the three parties involved in influencing public opinion  i e   media  influencers and general public   \n  \n   Relationship between opinion and public policy   \n The most pervasive issue dividing theories of the opinion policy relation bears a striking resemblance to the problem of monism pluralism in the history of philosophy  The controversy deals with the question of whether the structure of socio political action should be viewed as a more or less centralized process of acts and decisions by a class of key leaders  representing integrated hierarchies of influence in society or whether it is more accurately envisaged as several sets of relatively autonomous opinion and influence groups  interacting with representative decision makers in an official structure of differentiated governmental authority  The former assumption interprets individual  group and official action as part of a single system and reduces politics and governmental policies to a derivative of three basic analytical terms  society  culture and personality  \n Public opinion enables the organisation to expand internally and externally through public introspection  How does the latter assumption interpret individual  group and official action   clarify date June 2014   \n  \n   See

in these ways  \n  \n In 2007  the   American Psychological Association   published a report titled  \'  \' Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls \'  \'   discussed below  \n  \n In 2012  an American study found that self sexualization was common among 6   9 year old girls  Girls overwhelmingly chose the sexualized doll over the non sexualized doll for their ideal self and as popular  However other factors  such as how often mothers talked to their children about what is going on in TV shows and maternal religiosity  reduced those odds  Surprisingly  the mere quantity of girls    media consumption  TV and movies  was unrelated to their self sexualization for the most part  rather  maternal self objectification and maternal religiosity moderated its effects  lt ref gt

the form of  \' what we would like to see \'   On the theme of  \' the wallpaper of children \' s lives \'  it said that it would like to see that sexualised images used in public places should be more in line with what parents find acceptable  to ensure that images in public spaces becomes more child friendly  On theme two  \' clothing  products and services for children \'  the Bailey report said that it would like to see retailers no longer selling or marketing inappropriate clothing  products or services for children  What they would like to see on theme three  \' children as consumers \'  is comprehensive regulation protecting children from excessive commercial pressures across all media in line with parental expectations  that marketers are ethical and do not attempt to exploit gaps in the market to influence children into becoming consumers and to ensure that parents and children have an awareness of marketing techniques and regulations  Finally in terms of  \' making

the term has not been used to simply to label what is seen as a social problem  but to indicate the much broader and varied set of ways in which sex has become more visible in media and culture  These include  \n the widespread discussion of sexual values  practices and identities in the media  \n the growth of sexual media of all kinds  for example  erotica  slash fiction  sexual self help books and the many genres of pornography   \n the emergence of new forms of sexual experience  for example instant message or avatar sex made possible by developments in technology   \n a public concern

'A  \'  \'  \' Coalescer \'  \'  \'  is a technological device performing   Coalescence  meteorology  coalescence    They are primarily used to separate   emulsion  s into their components via various processes  operating in reverse to an   emulsifier    \n  \n A coalescer can be divided into mechanical and electrostatic coalescers  Mechanical coalescers use filters or baffles to make droplets coalesce while electrostatic coalescers use DC or AC electric fields  or combinations   \n  \n   Mechanical Coalescers   \n   Essay like section date August 2013   \n  \n A coalescer which operates by method of physical alteration or involvement of a droplet is influenced by  \'  \' mechanical \'  \'   or physical  means  A more common type of coalescer  mechanical coalescers are applied in oil and gas industries worldwide for removal of water or hydrocarbon condensate  While coalescers by definition function as a separation tool for liquids  they are commonly used  and mistakenly referred to  as   Filtration filters    \n  \n In the area of compressed air purification  coalescing filters are used to separate liquid water and oil from compressed air using a coalescing effect  These filters additionally remove particles  The most commonly used media in this case is Borosilicate micro fiber  \n  \n In the Oil and Gas  Petrochemical and Oil Refining industries  Liquid Gas coalescers are widely used to remove water and hydrocarbon liquids to  lt 0 011 ppmw  plus particulate matter to  lt 0 3 amp nbsp um in size  from natural gas to ensure natural gas quality and protect downstream equipment such as compressors  gas turbines  amine or glycol absorbers  molecular sieves  PSA \' s  metering stations  mercury guard beds  gas fired heaters or furnaces  heat exchangers or gas gas purification membranes  \n  \n In the Natural Gas industry  gas liquid coalescers are used for recovery of lube oil downstream of a compressor   All liquids will be removed but lube oil recovery is the primary reason for installing a coalescer on the outlet of a compressor   Liquids from upstream of the compressor  which may include aerosol particles  entrained liquids or large volumes of liquids called  quot slugs quot  and which may be water and or a combination of hydrocarbon liquids should be removed by a filter coalescing vessel located upstream of the compressor  Efficiencies of gas liquid coalescers are typically 0 3 Micron liquid particles  with efficiencies to 99 98   \n  \n Liquid liquid coalescers can also be used to separate hydrocarbons from water phases such as oil removal from   produced water    lt ref gt http   www opusplus co uk technology php pID 18   Coalescer Equipment Vendor lt  ref gt  They have been also used in pyrolysis gasoline  benzene  removal from quench water in ethylene plants  although in this application  the constant changing of cartridges can lead to operator exposure to   BTX  chemistry  BTX    benzene  toluene and xylene   as well as disposal issues and high operating costs from frequent replacement  \n  \n   Electrostatic Coalescers   \n  \n Electrostatic coalescers use electrical fields to induce droplet coalescence in water in crude oil emulsions to increasing the droplet size  The squared dependence of droplet diameter in Stokes Law  increase the settling speed and destabilizes the emulsion  The effects on the water droplet arise from the very different dielectric properties of the conductive water droplets dispersed in the insulating oil  Water droplets have a permittivity that is much higher than the surrounding oil  Furthermore  water with dissolved salt is also a very good conductor  When an uncharged droplet is subjected to an AC electric field the field will polarize the droplet creating an electric field around the droplet to counteract the external field  As the water droplet is very conductive the induced charges will reside on the surface  The droplet has no net charge but one positive and one negative side  Inside the droplet the electric field is zero  When two droplets with induced dipoles gets close to each other  they will experience a force pulling the droplets closer until they coalesce     \n  \n In oil production  co produced water is mixed with the oil in choke valves and process equipment producing water in oil emulsions  The amount of water increases during the production life of the reservoir  The emulsions are destabilized using gravitational separators  and the settling rates are increased by applying heat  demulsifiers  and AC electric fields  The AC electric field gives rise to attractive forces between water droplets and increases the probability of coalescence at contact  According to Stokes law  the settling rate increases proportionally with the square of the drop diameter  By promoting coalescence of small water droplets  the settling rate can be greatly increased  The water content is normally reduced to  lt 0 5 vol  if this is the final treatment stage before the crude oil is exported   \n  \n Typical electrocoalescers are large settling tanks containing electrodes and operates under laminar flow conditions with bare electrodes that may be vulnerable to short circuiting  An alternative to this type of coalescer is a flow through pre coalescer that is installed upstream in a separator tank  In the   Compact Electrostatic Coalescer    lt ref gt http   www tekna no ikbViewer Content 19748 Einar 20E 20Johnsen 20  20Glitne pdf   Compact Electrostatic Coalescer Conference Paper lt  ref gt   droplet coalescence is achieved by applying AC electric fields  50   60 amp nbsp Hz  to water in oil emulsions under turbulent flow conditions  The turbulence increases the collision frequency between the water drops  The electrodes are insulated to prevent short circuiting  and permits water contents of up to 40  as well as water slugs  The equipment is a separate flow through electrostatic treatment section installed upstream of a gravity separator to improve the performance  By keeping the treatment and settling sections separate  a compact electrostatic coalescer can be obtained that can also be retrofitted   \n  \n Liquid liquid coalecers are also widely used in oil refining industry to remove the last traces of contaminants like amine or caustic from intermediate products in oil refineries  and also for the last stage dewatering of final products like kerosene  jet fuel   LPG  gasoline and diesel to  lt 15 ppmw free water in the hydrocarbon phase  These coalescers are often electrostatic type  in which a DC electrical field encourages the water droplets to coalesce thus settling by gravity  \n  \n   References   \n   reflist   \n  \n ',3

drugs   \n  \n Thus  while the courts are an instrument frequently used by   pharmaceutical   brand name manufacturers to prolong their patent royalties  evergreening is rarely mentioned explicitly by judges in patent protection cases  The term usually refers to threats made to competitors about a brand name manufacturer \' s tactical use of pharmaceutical patents  including over uses  delivery

as 75  of new drug applications by generic drug manufacturers experiencing legal actions under patent laws by the original brand name patent owner  These were driving up US drug costs by keeping the

holder then has 45 days in which to initiate an application in the   Federal Court of Canada    seeking an order to prohibit the relevant Minister from issuing a Notice of Compliance to the generic

'  File Engine movingparts jpg thumb right some of the moving parts of an automobile engine   \n The  \'  \'  \' moving parts \'  \'  \'  of a   machine   are those parts of it that move   Machines include both moving  or movable  and fixed parts   The moving parts have controlled and constrained motions  lt ref name Bhandari2001   gt  lt ref name Goodeve1860   gt  \n  \n Moving parts do not include any moving fluids  such as   fuel      coolant   or   hydraulic fluid     Citation needed date July 2010   Moving parts also do not include any mechanical   lock  device  lock  s    switch  es    Nut  hardware  nuts   and   Screw bolts      screw cap  s for bottles etc  A system with no moving parts is described as  quot   Solid state  electronics  solid state   quot   \n  \n    Mechanical efficiency and wear    \n The amount of moving parts in a machine is a factor in its   mechanical efficiency     The greater the number of moving parts  the greater the amount of energy lost to heat by   friction   between those parts  lt ref name Balmer2008   gt   In a modern   automobile engine    for example  roughly 7  of the total   Power  physics  power   obtained from burning the engine \' s fuel is lost to friction between the engine \' s moving parts  lt ref name Moeller2002   gt  \n  \n Conversely  the fewer the number of moving parts  the greater the efficiency   Machines with no moving parts at all can be very efficient   An   electrical transformer    for example  has no moving parts  and its mechanical efficiency is generally above the 90  mark    The remaining power losses in a transformer are from other causes  including loss to electrical resistance in the copper windings and   hysteresis   loss and   eddy current   loss in the iron core   lt ref name Linsley2008   gt  \n  \n Two means are used for overcoming the efficiency losses caused by friction between moving parts   First  moving parts are   lubrication lubricated     Second  the moving parts of a machine are designed so that they have a small amount of contact with one another   The latter  in its turn  comprises two approaches   A machine can be reduced in size  thereby quite simply reducing the areas of the moving parts that rub against one another  and the designs of the individual components can be modified  changing their shapes and structures to reduce or avoid contact with one another  lt ref name Moeller2002   gt  \n  \n Lubrication also reduces   wear    as does the use of suitable materials   As moving parts wear out  this can affect the precision of the machine   Designers thus have to design moving parts with this factor in mind  ensuring that if precision over the lifetime of the machine is paramount  that wear is accounted for and  if possible  minimized    A simple example of this is the design of a simple single wheel   wheelbarrow     A design where the   axle   is fixed to the barrow arms and the wheel rotates around it is prone to wear which quickly causes wobble  whereas a rotating axle that is attached to the wheel and that rotates upon   bearing  mechanical  bearing  s in the arms does not start to wobble as the axle wears through the arms   lt ref name Wilson1952   gt  \n  \n The scientific and engineering discipline that deals with the lubrication  friction  and wear of moving parts is   tribology    an interdisciplinary field that encompasses   materials science      mechanical engineering      chemistry    and   mechanics    lt ref name Wakelin1974   gt  \n  \n    Failure    \n As mentioned  wear is a concern for moving parts in a machine  lt ref name Todinov2007   gt   Other concerns that lead to failure include   corrosion    lt ref name Todinov2007   gt    erosion    lt ref name Todinov2007   gt    thermal stress   and heat generation  lt ref name Todinov2007   gt    vibration    lt ref name Todinov2007   gt    fatigue loading    lt ref name Todinov2007   gt  and   cavitation      \n  \n Fatigue is related to large inertial forces  and is affected by the type of motion that a moving part has   A moving part that has a uniform rotation motion is subject to less fatigue than a moving part that oscillates back and forth   Vibration leads to failure when the  \'  \' forcing frequency \'  \'  of the machine \' s operation hits a   resonant frequency   of one or more moving parts  such as rotating shafts   Designers avoid this by calculating the natural frequencies of the parts at design time  and altering the parts to limit or eliminate such resonance    \n  \n Yet further factors that can lead to failure of moving parts include failures in the cooling and lubrication systems of a machine  lt ref name  quot Todinov2007 quot    gt  \n  \n One final  particular  factor related to failure of moving parts is kinetic energy   The sudden release of the kinetic energy of the moving parts of a machine causes overstress failures if a moving part is impeded in its motion by a foreign object  such as stone caught on the blades of a fan or propellor  or even the proverbial  quot   Wrench spanner     monkey wrench   in the works quot   lt ref name Todinov2007   gt   See   foreign object damage   for further discussion of this   \n  \n    Kinetic energy of the moving parts of a machine    \n The   kinetic energy   of a machine is the sum of the kinetic energies of its individual moving parts   A machine with moving parts can  mathematically  be treated as a connected system of bodies  whose kinetic energies are simply summed  The individual kinetic energies are determined from the kinetic energies of the moving parts \'    translation  physics  translation  s and   rotation  s about their axes  lt ref name Hibbeler2009   gt    \n  \n The  \'  \' kinetic energy of rotation of the moving parts \'  \'  can be determined by noting that every such system of moving parts can be reduced to a collection of connected bodies rotating about an instantaneous axis  which form either a ring or a portion of an ideal ring  of radius  lt math gt a lt  math gt  rotating at  lt math gt n lt  math gt    revolutions per minute revolutions per second     This ideal ring is

lt math gt  sum  k 0  n m k  times a k 2 lt  math gt  is the ring \' s   moment of inertia    denoted  lt math gt I lt  math gt    The rotational kinetic energy of the whole system of moving parts is  lt math gt  frac 1  2  I  omega 2 lt  math gt   where  lt math gt  omega lt  math gt   is the   angular velocity   of the moving parts about the same axis as the moment of inertia  lt ref name Hibbeler2009   gt  lt ref name Cotterill1884   gt  \n  \n The  \'  \' kinetic energy of translation \'  \'  of the moving parts is  lt math gt  frac 1  2  m v 2 lt  math gt   where  lt math gt m lt  math gt  is the total mass and  lt math gt v lt  math gt  is the   Magnitude  vector  magnitude   of the   velocity     This gives the formula for the  \'  \' total kinetic energy of the moving parts

factor  at the moment a technology is required  the most appropriate version can be taken down from the shelf based on costs of labor  capital and eventually raw materials   \n  \n Conversely  modern technology dynamics studies generally advocate that technologies are not    self evident    or market demanded  but are the upshot of a particular path of technology development and are shaped by social  economic and political factors  in this sense  technology dynamics aims at overcoming distinct    internal    and    external    points of views by presenting co evolutionary approach regarding technology development  \n  \n In general  technology dynamics studies  besides giving a    thick description    of technology development  uses constructivist viewpoints emphasizing that technology is the outcome of particular social context  Accordingly  Technology Dynamics emphasizes the significance and possibility of regaining   social control   of technology  and by the same token it provides mechanisms needed to adapt to and steer the development of certain technologies  In that respect  it uses insights from retrospective studies to formulate hypotheses of a prospective nature on technology development of emerging technologies  besides formulating prescriptive policy recommendations  \n  \n An important feature of relevant theories of technological change therein is that they underline the quasi evolutionary character of technological change  change based on technological variation and social selection in which technological knowledge  systems and   institutions   develop in interaction with each other  Processes of    path dependence    are crucial in explaining technological change   \n  \n Following these lines  there have been different approaches and concepts used under the field of technology dynamics  \n  \n   Different frameworks to analyze the dynamics of technology   \n    Social Construction of Technology   \n    Actor   network theory   \n    Systems theory   \n    Normalization process theory   \n  Quasi evolutionary theories \n    Innovation system   \n    Technological innovation system   \n  \n Based on the analysis of the various perspectives  one can aim at developing interventions in the dynamics of a technology  Some approaches have been developed targeting on interventions in technological change  \n  \n    Technology

' \n A  \'  \'  \' lock out device \'  \'  \'  is a system used on   game show  s  particularly trivia shows  to determine in real time which contestant has activated their signal first  The system is designed to detect the first signal it receives and ignore subsequent signals  The system provides some indication of which contestant has signaled  such as a light for each contestant  allowing the relevant parties to clearly determine who has signaled first  \n  \n The device used by a contestant to send a signal to the lock out system is called a  \'  \'  \' signaling device \'  \'  \'   or more commonly a  \'  \'  \' buzzer \'  \'  \'   perhaps due to the sound some early devices used to indicate signaling   They are typically a button on a hand held cylinder or mounted on a podium in front of the contestant  The act of signaling is commonly called ringing in  or buzzing in  \n  \n   History   \n Lock out devices were not always a mainstay in game shows  Early game shows lacked this technology  and those that required it made use of alternate  less precise  systems  For example  the 1969 game show  \'  \'   He Said  She Said  game show  He Said  She Said   \'  \'  required contestants to raise their hands  while the host and production staff determined visually which had raised their hands first  A similar  but more technical system was actually used in the earlier game show  \'  \'   Winner Take All  game show  Winner Take All   \'  \'   the show was one of  if not the first applications of this forerunner of the modern lock out  On the show  two contestants competed at answering trivia questions  with the first to ring in earning the right to answer  However  the technology was not yet developed for a lock out system  Instead  each contestant \' s hand signal sounded a different sound effect  a buzzer and a bell  perhaps influencing the future terms of ringing or buzzing in   Whichever was deemed to have sounded first was considered to have control  A modern lock out device essentially utilizes some sort of electronic system to do the determining with precision and certainty  rather than by human observation  \n  \n In general  though  a majority of early multi player game shows   even those dealing with trivia   simply lacked the gameplay element of pitting contestants against each other simultaneously  Competitive game shows instead took to having contestants alternate turns  such as in  \'  \'   Twenty One  game show  Twenty One   \'  \'    \'  \'   Pyramid  game show  Pyramid   \'  \'   and  \'  \'   Password  game show  Password   \'  \'   \n  \n Perhaps the most famous modern game show to use a lock out device is  \'  \'   Jeopardy    \'  \'   which uses a sophisticated system that is so fundamental to the game  mastering the signaling device is commonly said to be as or more important than knowing the answers to the questions  lt ref gt   cite book last Jennings first Ken title Brainiac  Adventures in the Curious  Competitive  Compulsive World of Trivia Buffs  publisher Villard year 2006 isbn 978 1 4000 6445 8   lt  ref gt  On  \'  \' Jeopardy  \'  \'  the lock out device has several advanced features  When the host finishes reading the question  a production assistant activates the lockout device  and the border of the game board lights up  which is not visible on broadcasts  Only at this point are contestants allowed to ring in  If a contestant rings in before the system and lights are activated  their signaling device is deactivated for a fraction of a second  \n  \n In 2000  sister show  \'  \'   Wheel of Fortune  U S  game show  Wheel of Fortune   \'  \'   aided by a new computerized video board  introduced a segment called  quot Toss up Puzzles quot  which introduced lock out devices to that show as well  In these short rounds  contestants would have to ring in to guess the answer to a puzzle whose letters were randomly revealed one at a time until solved  Currently  three of these rounds are played per show  with two of them determining who will start play in the subsequent standard round  \n  \n Other lock out devices can have more complex operations  On the 1975 game show   Split Second  game show  Split Second    the device determined the order in which the players signaled  in the show \' s revival in the 1980s  the order is displayed on the front of the contestant podiums  a 1  a 2  or a 3   In a similar vein  on  \'  \'   Merv Griffin \' s Crosswords Crosswords   \'  \'   the two competing contestants are joined in the second round by three  quot spoilers quot  who can replace one of the main contestants if they ring in and answer correctly  \n  \n However  the two main contestants are always given an opportunity to answer first if they ring in  even if it is later than the spoiler  This results in a five way system in which the order of ringing in is displayed on the front of each podium  1 or 2 on the main contestant \' s podiums  and 1  2  or 3 on the spoilers \'   Should all five players ring in on a question  the host can ask each of the main contestants for an answer in the order they rang in before moving on to the spoilers in the order they rang in  should no one provide the correct answer  by using the numbers on the podiums  \n  \n   References   \n   Reflist   \n   http   www pisspoor com buzzer html Jeopardy Buzzer observations

of certain forms of technology for personal use  \n  \n   Technophobia in arts   \n An early example of technophobia in fiction and popular culture is   Mary Shelley   \' s  \'  \'   Frankenstein   \'  \'   It has been a staple of   science fiction   ever since  exemplified by movies like Fritz Lang \' s   Metropolis  1927 film   \'  \' Metropolis \'  \'     which offer examples of how technophobia can occur  and   Charlie Chaplin   \' s   Modern Times  film   \'  \' Modern Times \'  \'     in which people are reduced to nothing but cogs in the machinery  a product of new industrial techniques like the   assembly line    This persisted through the 1950s  with the fears of   nuclear weapon  s and   radiation   leading to giant insects of   monster movie  s  as well as   cautionary tale  s like  \'  \'   The Day the Earth Stood Still   \'  \'   and into the 1960s  with the likes of   Hulk  comics  The Hulk    It was joined by fears of superintelligent machines  and rebellion amongst them  which was a recurring theme of  \'  \'   Star Trek   \'  \'   from the original series to  \'  \'   Star Trek  The Next Generation   \'  \'  to  \'  \'   Star Trek  Voyager   \'  \'  in the 1990s  \n  \n A 1960 episode of  \'  \'   The Twilight Zone  1959 TV series  The Twilight Zone   \'  \'  called  quot   A Thing About Machines   quot  deals with a man \' s hatred for modern things such as electric razors  televisions  electric typewriters and clocks  \n  \n Also in the 1960s  the film  \'  \'   Omega Man   \'  \'   loosely based on the   Richard Matheson   novel  \'  \'   I Am

s novel  \'  \'   A Canticle for Leibowitz   \'  \'   in which nuclear war produces an attempt to stamp out science itself  which is held to be responsible  \n  \n In the 1970s   \'  \'   Colossus  The Forbin Project   \'  \'  and  \'  \'   Demon Seed   \'  \'  also offered samples of domination by computers  Also in the 1970s    Rich Buckler   created   Deathlok the Demolisher Deathlok    a

have been the experts downloading their knowledge to the open minds of children   Technology and the learning tools it provides access to forces us to change to being facilitators of learning   We have to change the stereotype of teacher as the expert who delivers information and students as consumers of information in order to meet the needs of digital students  Teachers not only need to learn to speak digital  but also to embrace the language of Digital Natives  \n  \n Language is generally defined as a system used to communicate in which symbols convey information   Digital Natives can communicate fluently with digital devices and convey information in a way that was impossible without digital devices   People born prior to 1988 are generally referred to as Digital Immigrants   They speak with accents and experience difficulty programming simple devices like a VCR   Digital Immigrants do not start pushing buttons to make things work  \n  \n Learning a language is best done early

Students \'  struggle with Media and Information Literacy   \n Many students are considered illiterate in media and information because of various reasons   They may not see the value media and information literacy in the 21st century classroom   Others are not aware of the emergence of the new form of information   Educators need to introduce IML to these students to help them become media and information literate   Very little changes would be made if the educators are not supporting Information and Media Literacy in their own classrooms  \n  \n Performance standards  the foundation to support them  and tools to implement them are readily available   Success will come when there is full implementation and equitable access are established   Shared vision and goals that focus on strategic actions with measurable results are also necessary  \n  \n When  the staff  and community  working together  identify and clarify their values  beliefs  assumptions  and perceptions about what they want children to know and be able to do  an important next step will be to discover which of these values and expectations will be achieved   Lambert  1998  p  amp nbsp 6   Using the capacity tools to assess IML will allow students  staff and the community to reflect on how well students are meeting learning needs as related to technology  \n  \n The IML Performance standards allow data collection and analysis to evidence that student learning needs are being met   After assessing student IML  three questions can be asked  \n  \n  What does each student need to learn  \n  How does one know whether students have met the capacities  \n  How does one respond when students have difficulty in learning  \n  \n Teachers can use classroom assessment for learning to identify areas that might need increased focus and support   Students can use classroom assessment to set learning goals for themselves  \n  \n   Information and Media Literacy in the Curriculum   \n This

to work on the foundations to provide a sustainable and equitable access  the biggest obstacle will be school climate  \n  \n Marc Prensky  2006  para  25  identifies one barrier as teachers viewing digital devices as distractions by stating     Let   s admit the real reason that we ban cell phones is that  given the opportunity to use them  students would vote with their attention  just as adults would    vote with their feet    by leaving the room when a presentation is not compelling     \n  \n The mindset of banning new technology  fearing all bad things that can and sometimes do happen can affect educational decisions   The decision to ban digital devices impacts students for the rest of their lives  \n  \n Any tool that is used poorly or incorrectly can be unsafe   Safety lessons are mandatory in Industrial Technology and Science   Yet safety or ethical lessons are not mandatory to use technology  \n  \n Not all decisions in schools are measured by common ground beliefs   One school district in Ontario banned digital devices from their schools   Local schools have been looking at doing the same  These kinds of reactions are often about immediate actions and

Examples of existing privacy enhancing technologies are  \n    \'  \'  \'   Anonymizer Communication anonymizers   \'  \'  \'  hiding the real online identity  email address  IP address  etc   and replacing it with a non traceable identity  disposable   one time email address  random IP address of hosts participating in an anonymising network  pseudonym  etc    They can be applied to email  Web

personal data about him in the account profile   Moreover  he is freed from the hassle of having to register at the site himself   \n    \'  \'  \' Access to personal data \'  \'  \'   The service provider \' s infrastructure allows users to inspect  correct or delete all their data stored at the service provider  \n  \n   Future PETs   \n Examples of privacy enhancing technologies that are being researched or developed are  lt ref gt The EU PRIME research project \' s  https   www prime project eu prime products whitepaper PRIME Whitepaper V2 pdf White Paper   Version 2  lt  ref gt  \n    \'  \'  \' Wallets of multiple   virtual identities   \'  \'  \'   ideally unlinkable  Such wallets allow the efficient and easy creation  management and usage of virtual identities  \n    \'  \'  \' Anonymous credentials \'  \'  \'   asserted properties attributes or rights of the holder of the   credential   that don \' t reveal the real identity of the holder and that only reveal so much information as the holder of the credential is willing to disclose  The assertion can be issued by the user himself herself  by the provider of the online service or by a third party  another service provider  a government agency  etc    For example  \n     \'  \'  \' Online car rental \'  \'  \'   The car rental agency doesn \' t really need to know the true identity of the customer  It only needs to make sure that the customer is over 23  as an example   that the customer has a driving licence  that the customer has health insurance for accidents  as an example   and that the customer is paying  Thus no real need to know his her real name nor his her address nor any other   personal information    Anonymous credentials allow both parties to be comfortable  they allow the customer to only reveal so much data which the car rental agency needs for providing its service  data minimisation   and they allow the car rental agency to verify their requirements and get their money  When ordering a car online  the user  instead of providing the classical name  address and   credit card number    provides the following credentials  all issued to   pseudonym  s  i e  not to the real name of the customer  \n     An assertion of minimal age  issued by the state  proving that the holder is older than 23  i e  the actual age is not provided  \n     A   driving licence    i e  an assertion  issued by the motor vehicle control agency  that the holder is entitled to drive cars \n     A   proof of insurance    issued by the health insurance \n     Digital cash \n  With this data  the car rental agency is in possession of all the data it needs to rent the car  it can thus  as an example  provide the unlocking code to the customer with which he she can unlock the closet where the car key is kept  \n   Similar scenarios are buying wine at an Internet wine store or renting a movie at an online movie rental store  \n  \n    \'  \'  \' Negotiation and enforcement of data handling conditions \'  \'  \'   Before ordering a product or service online  the user and the online service provider or merchant negotiate the type of personal data that is to be transferred to the service provider  This includes the conditions that shall apply to the handling of the personal data  such as whether or not it may be sent to third parties  profile selling  and under what conditions  e g  only while informing the user   or at what time in the future it shall be deleted  if at all   As an example  it can be negotiated that personal data mustn \' t be handed out to third parties or that the data is to be deleted after 3 months following the end of the contract  While this negotiation takes place  the online service provider communicates his requirements about the minimum amount of data he needs to provide the wanted service  Additional personal data may be asked for  too  but will be clearly labelled as optional  After the transfer of personal data took place  the agreed upon data handling conditions are technically enforced by the infrastructure of the service provider  which is capable of managing and processing and data handling obligations  Moreover  this enforcement can be remotely audited by the user  for example by verifying chains of certification based on   Trusted computing   modules or by verifying privacy seals labels that were issued by third party auditing organisations  e g  data protection agencies   Thus instead of the user having to rely on the mere promises of service providers not to abuse   personal data    users will be more confident about the service provider adhering to the negotiated data handling conditions  \n  \n    \'  \'  \' Data transaction log \'  \'  \'   Users can log what personal data they sent to which service provider  when and under what conditions  These logs are stored and allow users to determine what data they have sent to whom  or they can establish the type of data that is in possession by a specific service provider  This leads to more   transparency  behavior  transparency    which is a pre requisite of being in control  \n  \n   The business case for PETs    \n Companies will usually only invest in technologies enhancing the privacy of their customers if they see a financial benefit  i e  if they anticipate a positive   business case     The other main reason being to comply with legal requirements  which could be considered as coming down to a  \' financial benefit \'  as well  the benefit of avoiding a fine for non compliance with the   law      The anticipated financial benefit is the anticipated increase of income due to privacy enhancing technologies  minus the anticipated increased cost of implementing and running privacy enhanced technologies in their infrastructure  This anticipated comparison is usually done over a couple of years  whereby the income and cost of every year is cumulated   \n  \n In other words  if the anticipated additional income cumulated over a couple of years is larger than the anticipated additional cost cumulated over the same number of years  then there is a positive business case and it makes sense for the company to consider implementing and deploying the privacy enhanced technologies in question  \n  \n Note that the business case outlined here is a  \' differential business case \'   assuming that privacy functions are added to an existing service and taking into account the additional benefits and costs caused by this added functionality   \n  \n For example  it would be wrong to account all operational costs  including those that were there before the privacy enhancing functions were added  Instead  only the additional costs incurring when operating the infrastructure with implemented privacy enhancements must be counted in  If  however  the service in consideration is a pure privacy enhancing service  i e  if the privacy enhancement is not part of or added to the service but instead is the only component of the service  then the business cost and benefit factors below become absolute  delete  quot additional quot  and  quot increased quot  in all benefits and cost components   \n  \n    Cost components    \n The anticipated additional cost components for an online service due to enhancing it with privacy protecting technologies are  \n   additional hardware \n   additional   software licences   \n   personnel costs for designing  developing  implementing  testing and deploying the privacy enhanced service  project costs  \n   additional personnel costs for \n    running   operating and maintaining the privacy enhanced service  with respect to what it would be if there were no such privacy enhancements  \n    fixing additional system failures or problems due to increased   system complexity    more functionality means higher complexity which leads to higher vulnerability  \n    product management of the additional privacy enhancing functions  more functions require more time spent to manage them  \n    more complex new developments of the infrastructure used to run the service \n    training customer support and supporting customers \n   additional marketing communications costs \n   loss of income as a consequence of additional service downtimes or problems due to increased service   system complexity \n   loss of income from selling data to third parties \n  \n    Benefit components    \n The anticipated additional income for an online service due to enhancing it with privacy protecting technologies divide up into the following components  \n   Increased usage of online services by existing customers and increased number of new customers due to \n    fulfilment of the need for privacy of customers  Some customers may only use the service if their privacy needs are fulfilled  other may use the service more often   \n    higher trust of customers in the service \n    increased public image and trust  especially if the privacy friendly attitude is advertised  \n    competitive advantage  if the competition doesn \' t have a similar offer  \n   increased customer retention  Customers appreciate the privacy enhancing functions of the service and don \' t like the idea of not finding them with competing services   \n   lower the risk of being fined for violating legal data protection requirements \n  \n   See also

'  Image Tecnology Life Cycle png right frame The typical life cycle of a manufacturing process or production system from the stages of its initial conception to its culmination as either a technique or procedure of common practice or to its demise  The Y axis of the diagram shows the business gain to the proprietor of the technology while the X axis traces its lifetime    \n  \n The  \'  \'  \' technology life cycle \'  \'  \'   TLC  describes the commercial gain of a product through the expense of research and development phase  and the financial return during its  quot vital life quot   Some technologies  such as steel  paper or cement manufacturing  have a long lifespan  with minor variations in technology incorporated with time  whilst in other cases  such as electronic or pharmaceutical products  the lifespan may be quite short  \n  \n The TLC associated with a product or technological service is different from product life cycle  PLC  dealt with in   product life cycle management    The latter is concerned with the life of a product in the marketplace with respect to timing of introduction  marketing measures  and business costs  The  \'  \' technology \'  \'  underlying the product  for example  that of a uniquely flavored tea  may be quite marginal but the process of creating and managing its life as a branded product will be very different   citation needed date October 2012   \n  \n The technology life cycle is concerned with the time and cost of developing the technology  the timeline of recovering cost  and modes of making the technology yield a profit proportionate to the costs and risks involved  The TLC may  further  be protected during its cycle with   patents   and   trademark  s seeking to lengthen the cycle and to maximize the profit from it  \n  \n The  quot product quot  of the technology may just be a commodity such as the polyethylene plastic or a sophisticated product like the ICs used in a   smartphone    \n  \n The development of a  \'  \' competitive product \'  \'  or process can have a major effect on the lifespan of the technology  making it shorter  Equally  the loss of intellectual property rights through litigation or loss of its secret elements  if any  through leakages also work to reduce a technology \' s lifespan  Thus  it is apparent that the  \'  \' management \'  \'  of the TLC is an important aspect of technology development  \n  \n In the simplest formulation  innovation can be thought of as being composed of research  development  demonstration  and deployment  lt ref gt   cite web url http   www eoearth org article Technological innovation title Technological Innovation   lt  ref gt  \n  \n Most new technologies follow a similar  \'  \'  \' technology maturity lifecycle \'  \'  \'  describing the   technological maturity   of a product  This is not similar to a   product life cycle management product life cycle    but applies to an entire technology  or a generation of a technology  \n  \n Technology adoption is the most common phenomenon driving the evolution of industries along the   industry lifecycle     After expanding new uses of resources they end with exhausting the efficiency of those processes  producing gains that are first easier and larger over time then exhaustingly more difficult  as the   mature technology technology matures     citation needed date October 2012   \n  \n   The four phases of the technology life cycle   \n  \n The TLC may be seen as composed of four phases  \n  \n    a  The  \'  \'  \' research and development   R amp D  \'  \'  \'  phase  sometimes called the  quot bleeding edge quot   when incomes from inputs are negative and where the prospects of failure are high  \n    b  The  \'  \'  \' ascent \'  \'  \'  phase when out of pocket costs have been recovered and the technology begins to gather strength by going beyond some Point A on the TLC  sometimes called the  quot leading edge quot    \n    c  The  \'  \'  \' maturity \'  \'  \'  phase when gain is high and stable  the region  going into saturation  marked by M  and  \n    d  The  \'  \'  \' decline \'  \'  \'   or decay phase   after a Point D  of reducing fortunes and utility of the technology  \n  \n    S curve    \n The shape of the technology lifecycle is often referred to as S curve  lt ref gt   cite web url http   www

Chandana Jayalath date 22 April 2010    lt  ref gt  \n  \n   Technology perception dynamics   \n There is usually   technology hype   at the introduction of any new technology  but only after some time has passed can it be judged as mere hype or justified true acclaim  \n Because of the   logistic curve   nature of technology adoption  it is difficult to see in the early stages whether the hype is excessive  \n  \n The two errors commonly committed in the early stages of a technology \' s development are  Citation needed date February 2007    \n   fitting an exponential curve to the first part of the growth curve  and assuming eternal   exponential growth    \n   fitting a linear curve to the first part of the growth curve  and assuming that take up of the new technology is disappointing \n  \n   Image DiffusionOfInnovation png thumb Rogers \'  bell curve 300px   \n Similarly  in the later stages  the opposite mistakes can be made relating to the possibilities of   mature technology technology maturity   and   market saturation    \n  \n   Technology Adoption LifeCycle Technology adoption   typically occurs in an S curve  as modelled in   diffusion of innovations   theory  This is because customers respond to new products in different ways    Diffusion of innovations   theory  pioneered by   Everett Rogers    posits that people have different levels of readiness for adopting new innovations and that the characteristics of a product affect overall adoption  Rogers classified individuals into five groups  innovators  early adopters  early majority  late majority  and laggards  In terms of the S curve  innovators occupy 2 5   early adopters 13 5   early majority 34   late majority 34   and laggards 16   \n  \n The four stages of technology life cycle are as follows  \n     Innovation stage  This stage represents the birth of a new product  material of process resulting from R amp D activities  In R amp D laboratories  new ideas are generated depending on gaining needs and knowledge factors  Depending on the resource allocation and also the change element  the time taken in the innovation stage as well as in the subsequent stages varies widely  \n     Syndication stage  This stage represents the demonstration and commercialisation of a new technology  such as  product  material or process with potential for immediate utilisation  Many innovations are put on hold in R amp D laboratories  Only a very small percentage of these are commercialised  Commercialisation of research outcomes depends on technical as well non technical  mostly economic factors  \n     Diffusion stage  This represents the market penetration of a new technology through acceptance of the innovation  by potential users of the technology  But supply and demand side factors jointly influence the rate of diffusion  \n     Substitution stage  This last stage represents the decline in the use and eventual extension of a technology  due to replacement by another technology  Many technical and non technical factors influence the rate of substitution  The time taken in the substitution stage depends on the market dynamics  \n  \n   Licensing options   \n  \n In current world trends   with TLCs shortening due to competition and rapid innovation  a  technology becomes technically licensable at all points of the TLC  whereas earlier  it was licensed only when it was past its maturity  stage  \n  \n Large corporations develop technology for their own benefit and not with the objective of licensing  The tendency to license out technology only appears when there is a threat to the life of the TLC  business gain  as discussed later  \n  \n    Licensing in the R amp D phase    \n  \n There are always smaller firms    Small and medium enterprises SMEs    who are inadequately situated to finance the development of innovative R amp D in the post research and early technology phases  By sharing incipient technology under certain conditions   substantial risk financing can come from third parties  This is a form of quasi licensing which takes different formats  Even large corporates may not wish to bear all costs of development in  areas of significant and high risk  e g  aircraft development  and may seek means of spreading  it to the stage that proof of concept is obtained  \n  \n In the case of small and medium firms  entities such as   venture capitalists     \' angels \'    can enter the scene and help to materialize technologies  Venture capitalists accept both the costs and uncertainties of R amp D  and that of market acceptance  in reward for high returns when the technology proves itself  Apart from finance  they may provide networking  management and marketing support  Venture capital connotes financial as well as human capital  \n  \n Large firms may opt for Joint R amp D or work in a consortium for the early phase of development  Such vehicles are called   strategic alliance  s     strategic partnerships  \n   \n With both venture capital funding and strategic  research  alliances  when business gains begin to neutralize development costs  the TLC crosses the X axis   the ownership of the technology starts to undergo change  \n  \n In the case  of smaller firms  venture capitalists help clients enter the stock market for obtaining substantially larger funds for development  maturation of  technology  product promotion and to meet marketing costs  A major route is through   Initial Public Offering initial public offering    IPO  which invites risk funding by the public for potential high gain  At the same time  the IPOs enable venture capitalists to attempt to recover expenditures already incurred by them through part sale of the stock pre allotted to them  subsequent to the listing of the stock on the stock exchange   When the IPO is fully subscribed  the assisted enterprise becomes a corporation and can more easily obtain bank loans  etc  if needed  \n  \n Strategic alliance partners  allied on research  pursue separate paths of development with the incipient technology of common origin but pool their accomplishments through instruments such as  \' cross licensing \'   Generally  contractual provisions among the members of the consortium allow a member to exercise the option of independent pursuit after joint consultation  in which case the optee owns all subsequent development  \n  \n    Licensing in the ascent phase     \n  \n The ascent stage of the technology usually refers to some point above Point A in the TLC diagram but actually it  commences when the R amp D portion of the TLC curve inflects  only that the cashflow is negative and unremunerative to Point A   The ascent is the strongest phase of the TLC because it is here that the technology is superior to alternatives and can command premium profit or gain  The slope and duration of the ascent depends on competing technologies entering the domain  although they may not be  \'  \' as successful \'  \'  in that period  Strongly patented technology extends  the duration period  \n  \n The TLC begins to flatten out  the region shown as M  when equivalent or challenging technologies come into the competitive space and begin to eat away marketshare  \n  \n Till this stage is reached  the technology owning firm would tend to exclusively enjoy its profitability  preferring  \'  \' not \'  \'  to license it  If an overseas opportunity does present itself  the firm would prefer to set up a  controlled subsidiary rather than license a third party  \n  \n    Licensing in the maturity phase    \n  \n The maturity phase of the technology is a period of stable and remunerative income but its competitive viability can persist over the larger timeframe marked by its  \' vital life \'   However  there may be a tendency to license out the technology to third parties during this stage to lower risk of  decline in profitability  or competitivity  and to expand financial opportunity  \n  \n The exercise of this option is  generally  inferior to seeking participatory exploitation  in other words  engagement in   joint venture    typically in regions where the technology would be in the  \'  \' ascent phase \'  \'  as say  a developing country  In addition to providing financial opportunity it allows the   technology owner a degree of control over its use  Gain flows from the two streams of investment based and royalty incomes  Further  the vital life of the technology is enhanced  in such strategy  \n  \n    Licensing in the decline phase    \n  \n After reaching a point such as D in the above diagram  the earnings from the technology begin to decline rather rapidly  To prolong the life cycle  owners of technology might try to license it out at  some point L when it can still be attractive to firms in other markets  This  then  traces the lengthening path  LL \'   Further  since the decline is the result of competing rising technologies in this space  licenses may be attracted to the general lower cost of the older technology  than what prevailed during its vital life   \n  \n Licenses obtained in this phase are  \' straight licenses \'   They are free of direct control from the owner of the technology  as would otherwise apply  say  in the case of a joint venture   Further  there may be fewer restrictions placed on the licensee in the employment of the technology  \n  \n The utility  viability  and thus the cost of straight licenses depends on the estimated  \' balance life \'  of the technology  For instance  should the key patent on the technology have expired  or would expire in a short while  the residual viability of the technology may be limited  although balance life may be governed by other criteria viz    knowhow   which could have a longer life if properly protected  \n  \n  \'  \' It is important to note that the license has no way of knowing the stage at which the prime  and competing technologies  are on their TLCs \'  \'   It would  of course  be evident to competing licensor firms  and to the originator  from the growth  saturation or decline of the profitability of their operations  \n  \n The license may  however  be able to approximate the stage by vigorously negotiating with the licensor and competitors to determine costs and licensing terms  A lower cost  or easier terms   \'  \' may \'  \'  imply a declining technology  \n  \n In any case  access to technology in the decline phase is a large risk that the licensee accepts   In a joint venture this risk is substantially reduced by licensor  sharing it   Sometimes  financial guarantees from the licensor may work  to reduce such risk and can be negotiated  \n  \n There are instances when  even though the  technology declines to becoming a technique  it may still contain important knowledge or experience which the licensee firm cannot learn of without help from the originator  This  is often the  form that  \'  \' technical service \'  \'  and  \'  \' technical assistance \'  \'  contracts take  encountered often in developing country contracts   Alternatively  consulting agencies may fill this role  \n  \n    Technology development cycle    \n   Technology development cycle   describes the process of a new technology through the stages of technological maturity  \n

'There are a number of theories attempting to address   technology    which tend to be associated with the disciplines of   Science and Technology Studies science and technology studies    STS  and   communication studies    Most generally  the theories attempt to address the relationship between   technology and society   and prompt questions about   Structure and agency agency      Technological Determinism determinism autonomy    and   teleonomy    \n  \n If forced  one might categorize them into social and group theories  Additionally  one might distinguish between descriptive and critical theories   \'  \' Descriptive \'  \'  theories attempt to address the definition and substance of technology  the ways it has emerged  changed and its relation to the human social sphere  More substantively it addresses the extent of which technology is autonomous and how much force it has in determining human practice or social structure   \'  \' Critical \'  \'   \'  \'  \' theories of technology \'  \'  \'  often take a descriptive theory as their basis and articulate concerns  examining what way the relationship can be changed  The authors mentioned in this article are those that have some concern with technology or media  though they often borrow from one another and of course build upon seminal theorists that preceded them  \n  \n    Social theories    \n  \n     Descriptive approaches     \n  \n     Social construction of technology    SCOT    argues that technology does not determine human action  but that human action shapes technology  Key concepts include  \n     \'  \'  \' interpretive flexibility \'  \'  \'    quot Technological artifacts are culturally constructed and interpreted     By this we mean not only that there is flexibility in how people think of or interpret artifacts but also that there is flexibility in how artifacts are designed  quot   \n     \'  \'  \' Relevant social group \'  \'  \'   shares a particular set of meanings about an artifact \n     \'  \'  \'  \'  \'  \' Closure \'  \'  \'  and stabilization \'  \'  \'   when the relevant social group has reached a consensus  \n     \'  \'  \' Wider context  \'  \'  \'   quot the sociocultural and political situation of a social group shapes its norms and values  which in turn influence the meaning given to an artifact quot   \n   Key authors include MacKensie and Wajcman  1985   amp  Pinch and Bijker  1992   \n  \n     Actor network theory    ANT     posits a heterogeneous network of humans and non humans as equal interrelated actors  It strives for impartiality in the description of human and nonhuman actors and the reintegration of the natural and social worlds  For example  Latour  1992  argues that instead of worrying whether we are anthropomorphizing technology  we should embrace it as inherently anthropomorphic  technology is made by humans  substitutes for the actions of humans  and shapes human action  What is important is the chain and gradients of actors \'  actions and competences  and the degree to which we choose to have figurative representations  Key concepts include the  \'  \'  \' inscription \'  \'  \'  of beliefs  practices  relations into technology  which is then said to  \'  \'  \' embody \'  \'  \'  them  Key authors include   Bruno Latour Latour    1997  and Callon  1999   \n  \n    Structuration theory     defines structures as rules and resources organized as properties of social systems  The theory employs a recursive notion of actions constrained and enabled by structures which are produced and reproduced by that action  Consequently  in this theory technology is not rendered as an artifact  but instead examines how people  as they interact with a technology in their ongoing practices  enact structures which shape their emergent and situated use of that technology  Key authors include DeSantis and Poole  1990   and Orlikowski  1992   \n  \n     Systems theory     considers the historical development of technology and media with an emphasis on inertia and heterogeneity  stressing the connections between the artifact being built and the social  economic  political and cultural factors surrounding it  Key concepts include   reverse salient  s when elements of a system lag in development with respect to others  differentiation    operational closure    and   autopoietic autonomy    Key authors include   Thomas P  Hughes    1992  and   Niklas Luhmann Luhmann    2000   \n  \n     Activity theory   \n  \n     Critical approaches     \n  \n   Critical theory   goes beyond a descriptive account of how things are  to examine why they have come to be that way  and how they might otherwise be  Critical theory asks whose interests are being served by the   status quo   and assesses the potential of future alternatives to better serve social justice  According to Geuss \' s definition   quot a critical theory  then  is a reflective theory which gives agents a kind of knowledge inherently productive of enlightenment and emancipation quot   1981  2   Critical theory has the explicit normative and political intent of going beyond mere description to produce actual change  \n  \n Along with other   Frankfurt School   critical theorists   Herbert Marcuse   began developing a critical theory of technology in both soviet communism and western capitalism in  \' One Dimensional Man \'   1964   Marcuse argued that whilst matters of technology design are often presented as neutral technical choices in fact they manifest political or moral values  Critical theory is a form of archaeology that attempt to get beneath common sense understandings in order to  reveal the power relationships and interests determining particular technological configuration and use   \n   \n Perhaps the most developed contemporary critical theory of technology is contained in the works of   Andrew Feenberg   including  \' Transforming Technology \'   2002   \n  \n   Values in Design   asks how do we ensure a place for values  alongside technical standards such as speed  efficiency  and reliability  as criteria by which we judge the quality and acceptability of information systems and new media  How do values such as privacy  autonomy  democracy  and social justice become integral to conception  design  and development  not merely retrofitted after completion  Key thinkers include   Nissenbaum    2001   \n  \n     Other stances     \n  \n Additionally  many authors have posed technology so as to critique and or emphasize aspects of technology as addressed by the mainline theories  For example    Steve Woolgar    1991  considers  \'  \' technology as text \'  \'  in order to critique the   sociology of scientific knowledge   as applied to technology and to distinguish between three responses to that notion  the instrumental response  interpretive flexibility   the interpretivist response  environmental organizational influences   the reflexive response  a double hermeneutic   Pfaffenberger  1992  treats  \'  \' technology as drama \'  \'  to argue that a recursive structuring of technological artifacts and their social structure discursively regulate the technological construction of political power  A technological drama is a discourse of technological  quot statements quot  and  quot counterstatements quot  within the processes of technological regularization  adjustment  and reconstitution  \n  \n An important philosophical approach to technology has been taken by   Bernard Stiegler    whose work has been influenced by other philosophers and historians of technology including   Gilbert Simondon   and   Andr   Leroi Gourhan    \n In the Schumpeterian and Neo Schumpeterian theories technologies are critical factors of   economic growth      Carlota Perez     \n  \n    Group theories    \n  \n There are also a number of technology related theories that address how  media  technology affects group processes  Broadly  these theories are concerned with the social effects of communication media  Some  e g   media richness  are concerned with questions of media choice  i e   when to use what medium effectively   Other theories  social presence  SIDE  media naturalness  are concerned with the consequences of those media choices  i e   what are the social effects of using particular communication media   \n  \n     Social presence theory    Short  et al   1976  is a seminal theory of the social effects of communication technology  Its main concern is with telephony and telephone conferencing  the research was sponsored by the British Post Office  now British Telecom   It argues that the social impact of a communication medium depend on the  \'  \' social presence \'  \'  it allows communicators to have  Social presence is defined as a property of the medium itself  the degree of acoustic  visual  and physical contact that it allows  The theory assumes that more contact will increase the key components of  quot presence quot   greater intimacy  immediacy  warmth and inter personal rapport  As a consequence of social presence  social influence is expected to increase  In the case of communication technology  the assumption is that more text based forms of interaction  e mail  instant messaging  are less social  and therefore less conducive to social influence  \n  \n     Media richness theory    Daft  amp  Lengel  1986  shares some characteristics with social presence theory  It posits that the amount of information communicated differs with respect to a medium \' s  \'  \' richness \'  \'   The theory assumes that resolving ambiguity and reducing uncertainty are the main goals of communication  Because communication media differ in the rate of understanding they can achieve in a specific time  with  quot rich quot  media carrying more information   they are not all capable of resolving uncertainty and ambiguity well  The more restricted the medium \' s capacity  the less uncertainty and equivocality it is able to manage  It follows that the richness of the media should be matched to the task so as to prevent over simplification or complication  \n  \n     Media naturalness theory    Kock  2001  2004  builds on human evolution ideas and has been proposed as an alternative to media richness theory  Media naturalness theory argues that since our Stone Age hominid ancestors have communicated primarily face to face  evolutionary pressures have led to the development of a brain that is consequently designed for that form of communication  Other forms of communication are too recent and unlikely to have posed evolutionary pressures that could have shaped our brain in their direction  Using communication media that suppress key elements found in face to face communication  as many electronic communication media do  thus ends up posing cognitive obstacles to communication  This is particularly the case in the context of complex tasks  e g   business process redesign  new product development  online learning   because such tasks seem to require more intense communication over extended periods of time than simple tasks  \n  \n   Media synchronicity theory  MST  Dennis  amp  Valacich  1999  redirects richness theory towards the  \'  \' synchronicity \'  \'  of the communication  \n  \n   The   Social Identity model of Deindividuation Effects  SIDE     Postmes  Spears and Lea 1999  Reicher  Spears and Postmes  1995  Spears  amp  Lea  1994  was developed as a response to the idea that anonymity and reduced presence made communication technology socially impoverished  or  quot deindividuated quot    It provided an alternative explanation for these  quot   deindividuation   effects quot  based on theories of social identity  e g   Turner et al   1987   The SIDE model distinguishes cognitive and strategic effects of a communication technology  Cognitive effects occur when communication technologies make  quot salient quot  particular aspects of personal or social identity  For example  certain technologies such as email may disguise characteristics of the sender that individually differentiate them  i e   that convey aspects of their personal identity  and as a result more attention may be given to their social identity  The strategic effects are due to the possibilities  afforded by communication technology  to selectively communicate or enact particular aspects of identity  and disguise others  SIDE therefore sees the social and the technological as mutually determining  and the behavior associated with particular communication forms as the product or interaction of the two  \n  \n   Time  interaction  and performance  TIP  McGrath  1991  theory describes work groups as time based  multi modal  and multi functional social systems  Groups interact in one of the modes of inception  problem solving  conflict resolution  and execution  The three functions of a group are production  towards a goal   support  affective  and well being  norms and roles   \n  \n    Analytic theories    \n  \n Finally  there are theories of technology which are not defined or claimed by a proponent  but are used by authors in describing existing literature  in contrast to their own or as a review of the field  \n  \n For example  Markus and Robey  1988  propose a general technology theory consisting of the causal structures of agency  technological  organizational  imperative  emergent   its structure  variance  process   and the level  micro  macro  of analysis  \n  \n Orlikowski  1992  notes that previous conceptualizations of technology typically differ over scope  is technology more than hardware   and role  is it an external objective force  the interpreted human action  or an impact moderated by humans   and identifies three models  \n    \'  \'  \' Technological imperative  \'  \'  \'  focuses on organizational characteristics which can be measured and permits some level of contingency \n    \'  \'  \' Strategic choice  \'  \'  \'  focuses on how technology is influenced by the context and strategies of decision makers and users \n    \'  \'  \' Technology as a trigger of structural change  \'  \'  \'  views technology as a social object \n  \n DeSanctis and Poole  1994  similarly write of three views of technology \' s effects   \n    \'  \'  \' Decision making  \'  \'  \'  the view of engineers associated with positivist  rational  systems rationalization  and deterministic approaches \n    \'  \'  \' Institutional school  \'  \'  \'  technology is an opportunity for change  focuses on social evolution  social construction of meaning  interaction and historical processes  interpretive flexibility  and an interplay between technology and power \n    \'  \'  \' An integrated perspective  social technology   \'  \'  \'  soft line determinism  with joint social and technological optimization  structural symbolic interaction theory \n  \n Bimber  1998  addresses the determinacy of technology effects by distinguishing between the  \n    \'  \'  \' Normative  \'  \'  \'  an autonomous approach where technology is an important influence on history only where societies attached cultural and political meaning to it  e g   the industrialization of society  \n    \'  \'  \' Nomological  \'  \'  \'  a naturalistic approach wherein an inevitable technological order arises based on laws of nature  e g   steam mill had to follow the hand mill    \n    \'  \'  \'  \'  \'  \'   Unintended consequence  s  \'  \'  \'  \'  \'  \'  a fuzzy approach that is demonstrative that technology is contingent  e g   a car is faster than a horse  but unbeknownst to its original creators become a significant source of pollution  \n  \n    References    \n  \n

frequently used to examine the temporal characteristics of attention  The RSVP paradigm entails participants to look at a continuous presentation of visual items which is around 10 items per second  They are all shown in the same place  The targets are implanted inside this stream of continuous items  They are separate from the rest of the items and can be called distracters  The distracters can either be a color change or it can be letters that are among the numbers   \n  \n   Overview   \n There is a delay of several hundred milliseconds   For example  a person might be asked to identify numbers in a string of letters which are shown one by one  The first number which is an important target  would be caught by the person  however  the second number flashed seconds later might not be observed   There are a number of theories to explain how and why this works and studies have explored its limitations and parameters to learn more about visual perception   \n The brain deals with a quick stream of incoming information at all times  With the attentional blink  the brain has to distribute its attentional resources to comprehend  interpret  and store the information properly  The human brain is able of processing complex tasks  but it has restrictions  The attentional blink is an illustration that has a significant insinuation for individuals who work in environments where they are usually swamped with information  An example of this is an airport baggage screener who might see a knife in one bag  but misses a second knife in another bag that is right behind the first bag   The failure to recognize the second target is because of the attentional processes that are linked with the identification of the first target  \n  \n   History   \n  \n Potter  1976   lt ref gt

the same rate  Here  participants must attend to a target that is shown for about 100 milliseconds  This is an advantage of this static mode  A disadvantage of the static mode is that there is no chance after that time to validate what was seen   The attentional blink which usually lasts between 300 400 milliseconds leads up to the other stimuli not being seen  The static mode can produce three different aspects when looking at an image  steady gaze  search to steady and visual search  \n  \n    Moving modes    \n We are usually represented with presentations that rely a great deal on movement of pictures in a 2D plane  These are more difficult to register in comparison than pictures that move back and forth  The basic psychology of human visual perception explains that people are inclined to register imagery in a 3D world  This mode believes rapid serial visual presentation is important when approaching and processing objects  The moving mode can produce three different

community   to reverse the US declining economic and military competitiveness   The program    Project Socrates    used all source intelligence to review competitiveness worldwide for all forms of competition to determine the source of the US decline   What Project Socrates determined was that technology exploitation is the foundation of all   competitive advantage   and that the source of the US declining competitiveness was the fact that decision making through the US both in the private and public sectors had switched from decision making that was based on technology exploitation  i e   technology based planning  to decision making that was based on money exploitation  i e   economic based planning  at the end of World War II  \n  \n Technology is properly defined as any application of science to accomplish a function  The science can be leading edge or well established and the function can have high visibility or be significantly more mundane but it is all technology  and its exploitation is the foundation of all competitive advantage  \n  \n Technology based planning is what was used to build the US industrial giants before WWII  e g     Dow Chemical Company Dow      DuPont      General Motors GM    and it what was used to transform the US into a   superpower    It was not economic based planning  \n  \n Project Socrates determined that to rebuild US competitiveness  decision making throughout the US had to readopt technology based planning   Project Socrates also determined that countries like China and India had continued executing technology based  while the US took its detour into economic based  planning  and as a result had considerably advanced the process and were using it to build themselves into superpowers   To rebuild US competitiveness the US decision makers needed to adopt a form of technology based planning that was far more advanced than that used by China and India  \n  \n Project Socrates determined that technology based planning makes an evolutionary leap forward every few hundred years and the next evolutionary leap  the Automated Innovation Revolution  was poised to occur   In the Automated Innovation Revolution the process for determining how to acquire and utilize technology for a competitive advantage  which includes R amp D  is automated so that it can be executed with unprecedented

' \n  \'  \'  \' Music instrument technology \'  \'  \'  refers to the construction of   Musical instrument instruments   and the way they have changed over time  Such change has produced modern instruments that are considerably different from their   Musical instrument Modern historical antecedents    \n  \n An example is the way in which many instruments commonly associated with a modern symphony orchestra are markedly different from the same instruments for which European composers were composing music centuries ago   \n  \n Such changes include the addition of piston valves to brass instruments  the design of more complex fingering systems for woodwind instruments such as the flute  and the standardization of the family of orchestral string instruments  \n  \n Many advancements were made in music instrument technology during the   Middle Ages   and 19th Century  The introduction of copper smelting allowed for   trumpets      organ pipes    and slides to be constructed with sheet metal which had a smooth texture and consistency in thickness  allowing for more range of tones and sounds  Improvements in molding and casting during the 19th Century allowed for technological advancement to   pianos    While originally constructed with wooden frames  limiting the amount of sound that could be produced  pianos began to be constructed of one piece iron frames  This provided a more amplified volume from the instrument and allowed musicians to use less force when playing the instrument  Improvements in drum tuning were also established at this time  The  quot Dresden quot  model of tuning  involving steel technology and employing a foot petal with ratchet in order to attach the device to the   timpani    was invented by Carl Pittrich  This technology allowed for timpani to be tuned much faster by the musician  The Dresden tuners could also be added onto existing timpani  allowing symphonies to continue using their existing instruments while still employing this new technology  Lastly  the 19th century also lead to the development of valves  and when added in to the construction of trumpets and   horn  instrument  horns    they allowed for the instruments to express a broader range to the harmonic series of notes being produced   lt ref gt   cite web last Bowles first Edmund title The Impact of Technology on Musical Instruments url http   www cosmosclub org web journals 1999 bowles html publisher Cosmos Club accessdate 17 October 2013   lt  ref gt      \n  \n Some of this technology represents patentable advancements in the musical instrument industry   See  http   blog hdp com category music industry  Musical Instrument Patent of Week  \n  \n   See also   \n     Organology   \n      Category Musical instrument makers Category Musical instrument makers   \n      Category Musical instrument manufacturing companies Category Musical instrument manufacturing companies   \n  \n   References   \n   reflist   \n  \n Bowles  Edmund A   quot The Impact of Technology on Musical Instruments  quot   \'  \' Cosmos Club  \'  \'  N p   n d  Web 16 Oct  2013  \n  \n   Musical instrument stub   \n  \n   DEFAULTSORT Music Instrument Technology   \n   Category Musical instruments Technology   \n ',3
