The Internet has an immense importance in our day to day life, but at the same time, it has become the most advantageous medium of infecting computers, attacking users, and distributing malicious code. As JavaScript is the principal language of client side programming, it is frequently used in conducting such attacks. Various approaches have been made to overcome the JavaScript security issues. Some advanced approaches utilize machine learning technology in combination with deobfuscation and emulation. Many methods of analysis incorporate static analysis and dynamic analysis. Our solution is entirely based on static analysis, which avoids unnecessary runtime overhead.
